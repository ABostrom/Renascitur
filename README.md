# 🌍 Renascitur - A DnD Worldbuilding Project

Welcome to **Renascitur**, a high-fantasy worldbuilding project years in the making. This repository contains the evolving lore, history, and mythos of a custom Dungeons & Dragons setting created by [Aaron Bostrom](https://github.com/aaronbostrom) and collaborators.

## 🗺️ Project Overview

**Renascitur** is a mythic world where ancient civilizations, broken divine machinery, and eldritch corruption shape the fate of its peoples. Drawing from cosmic horror, fallen empires, and ancestral legacy, the world is filled with:

- 🌞 Lost Solarans and the ruined Endless Sun
- 🧬 Bioengineered races like the Saurians
- ⚙️ Rune magic and divine forges
- 🕯️ Spirits trapped in the broken [[Machinery of Death]]
- 🛐 Mortal-born gods and aberrant horrors

## 🧬 Major Cultures & Factions of Renascitur

### 🔩 Dwarves
Descendants of the Grundthain, divided into three major holds:
- **Magnus' Rest**
- **Mithral Hall**
- **Uftine**
- **Draumhavn
All three are linked by a subterranean railway and allied with the Ferrun.

### ⚙️ Ferrun
Descendants of the Solarans, embracing science and rune-smithing. Centered in **Thelassia**, they revere **[[Muradin]]** in his original Grundthain form and preserve the **Sanctuary of Iron**.

### 🔥 Firebrand Empire
A human empire. Ruled by an Emperor and **The Twelve Great Houses**, citizenship is earned through service. Anti-magic, yet technologically advanced. Society is divided between citizens and the oppressed **Stained** class. Massive **lux lapis** walls protect the empire from aberrant horrors.

### 🧬 Saurians
Bio-engineered guardians of the island of Mokoweri, created by the Solarans to resist aberrant corruption. Spiritually bonded with the land and the **Mokoweri** people, some have mutated into Slaad-like aberrant forms.

### 🌿 Rahalan
Matriarchal desert nomads who sail living **Gaia-ships**, guided by visions and rites. Their society is spiritually rooted and structured around roles such as Dreamweavers, Grove Shapers, and Battle Sisters.

### 🐉 Kyojin
Spiritual proto-orcs connected to the **Tree of Spirit**. First to discover and seal the **[[Machinery of Death]]**, they embody the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

### 🌠 Solarans
Ancient star-born race whose civilization fell after the corruption of the **Endless Sun**. Splintered into:
- **Arcanii**
- **Mokoweri**
- **Ferrun**

### 🧝‍♂️ Thaysian Magocracy
Based in **Eltabarr**, this elite arcane society is governed by the **Majlis of Arcane Sovereignty**:
- **Aelar Amakiir**
- **Zariel Mephistar** 
- **Farid al-Hakim**
Eltabarr is a beacon of magical power and political complexity.

### 🧠 Ilithids
Corrupted Solarans twisted by aberrant energy during forbidden experimentation. Now aligned with **[[Ishna]]**, [[Ishna|the God Unborn]].
