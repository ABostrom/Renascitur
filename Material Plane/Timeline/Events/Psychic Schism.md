After the psychic schism, great swathes of the population were killed. The world reacted in utter terror at the devastation and destruction of civilization as they knew it. 

Kingdom’s fell, and civilization crumbled. Humanity regressed into small homesteads that barely communicated. Travel between neighbouring villages was all but impossible as during the night the creatures descend on travellers far from light sources.

During the nights following the schism, as [[aberrations]] rained from the sky, and sprung out of the shadows, so too did bright rocks of glowing light. Showers of white stones fell from the sky accompanying the abominations ([[Lux Lapis]]).

A mighty [[Leonin]] warrior appeared one day, wielding an axe made of what seemed to be pure light. He had forged the weapon from the fallen stars that rained from the sky since the schism, and slew thousands of the night terrors. He formed the firebrand empire, taught warriors and artisans of all races how to forge the [[Light Wards]] and began retaking the continent. This became known as the beginning of the [[Night War]].
