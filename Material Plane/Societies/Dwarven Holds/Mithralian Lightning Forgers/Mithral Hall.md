Mithral Hall is a magnificent underground city located in the far north of the world of Renascitur. The city is home to thousands of dwarves who live and work amidst the glowing mithril veins that run throughout the caverns. The air is filled with the sound of hammering and the clang of metal as the dwarves tirelessly work to forge their wondrous creations.

The architecture of Mithral Hall is a marvel of engineering, with towering arches and intricate stonework carved into the walls. The city is divided into several districts, each with its own unique character. The main thoroughfare is known as Thunder Way, a broad street lined with shops and market stalls selling all manner of dwarven wares.

One of the most impressive features of Mithral Hall is the [[Great Forge]], which lies at the heart of the city. This massive chamber is dominated by a towering furnace that burns day and night, fueled by the veins of mithril that run beneath the city. The forge is tended by skilled dwarven smiths who create weapons, armour, and other wondrous items that are the envy of all who behold them.

The dwarves of Mithral Hall are known for their mastery of lightning magic, a skill they learned from the ancient dragon [[Ormr]] who once made his home in the city. The dwarves work closely with the dragon to harness the power of electricity in their smithing and crafting, creating weapons and devices that are imbued with the crackling energy of lightning.

Mithral Hall is not without its dangers, however. The night terrors that roam the world pose a constant threat, and the dwarves have developed a variety of automated devices to defend the city from attack. Massive stone golems patrol the streets, while powerful lightning cannons are mounted on the walls to strike down any invaders who dare to approach.

Despite these dangers, Mithral Hall remains a bastion of dwarven culture and technology, a shining example of the ingenuity and skill of the dwarven race.
