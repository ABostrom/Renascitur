An obsidian black crystal, originally created by [[Vecna]] to house the souls of mortal beings. These were used to power the [[Forgeborn]] and give them life. 

They manifested as black kristals as the [[souls]] housed inside them became corrupted by the necromantic energy infused to give them new “incorruptable” souls.
