Storm Quartz is a gemstone that is normally a light blue in colour, but its appearance changes when it is charged by lightning.

When uncharged, Storm Quartz has a delicate, pale blue hue reminiscent of a clear summer sky. However, when it is struck by lightning, the gemstone's appearance transforms dramatically. The once-pale blue colour deepens and becomes more vibrant, taking on an electric blue hue that seems to pulse with energy.

The charged Storm Quartz is said to possess even greater power than the uncharged gemstone, as it has absorbed the energy of the lightning strike. It is believed that those who possess a charged Storm Quartz can harness this energy to manipulate the weather, summoning fierce storms and controlling the elements.

Due to its unique properties, Storm Quartz is highly prized by those who seek to control the weather or harness the power of the storm. However, finding a charged Storm Quartz is a rare and dangerous task, as it requires braving the elements and risking one's life in the pursuit of this powerful gemstone.

As such, Storm Quartz is both revered and feared, with many myths and legends surrounding its origins and powers. Whether one seeks to harness its power or simply admire its beauty, there is no denying the allure of this fascinating gemstone.
