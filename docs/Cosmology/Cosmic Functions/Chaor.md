**Aspect**: Freedom, Instinct, Motion, Change

**Associated Races**: [[Kyojin]], [[Orc|Orcs]]  
**Place in [[Weave|the Weave]]**: One of the four cosmic forces that sustain reality.

---

Chaor is the **force of change**—wild and necessary. It fuels invention, movement, growth, and the refusal to be bound. It is the fire in the breath, the break from tradition, the will to *become*.

Without it, form calcifies, and spirit dies.

## Symbols
- A spiral flame or a streaked comet.
- An open hand, palm to the wind.

## Cultural Notes
- The [[Orc|Orcs]] trace their [[soul]]-rites and freedom-paths to Chaor’s breath.
- Among the Kyojin, Chaor was held in sacred tension with [[Ordar]].

## In Opposition
Chaor without balance becomes **anarchy**, **self-destruction**, and **loss of identity**.
