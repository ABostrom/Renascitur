The universe is founded on 4 opposing forces [[Luxar]] and it's opposite [[Noxar]], [[Ordar]] and it's opposite [[Chaor]]. These four forces bind the [[Planes]] and lead to the cyclical nature of the universe and the manifestation of [[Renascita]] as they are perfectly balanced in an unending interwoven system of energy, often known as [[Weave]].
