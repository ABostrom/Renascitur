**Aspect**: Law, Structure, Memory, Discipline

Ordar is the **force of structure**—the spine of empires, the memory of generations, the form that allows function. It preserves identity, gives shape to will, and carries the weight of duty.

It is the code, the monument, the spoken oath. It is vital—but incomplete without motion.

## Symbols
- A squared spiral or interlocking rings.
- An unbroken pillar etched with script.

## Cultural Notes
- The [[Kyojin]] held Ordar in balance with [[Chaor]] through the philosophy of [[Concorda]].
- The [[Firebrand Empire]] reveres Ordar as the foundation of its meritocratic order.

## In Opposition
Ordar without balance becomes **tyranny**, **stagnation**, and **soulless hierarchy**.
