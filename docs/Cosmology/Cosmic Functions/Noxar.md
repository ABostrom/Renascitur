Noxar is the **force of shadow**, not as evil, but as **depth, concealment, and introspection**. It allows growth in silence, power in stillness, and possibility unshaped by premature light.

It is the veil, the hidden path, the memory left unsaid. Without Noxar, no truth could be uncovered—only imposed.

## Symbols
- A crescent moon cupped by black flame.
- A closed eye within a circle.

## Cultural Notes
- [[Solaran|Solarans]] saw Noxar not as a threat to [[Luxar]], but as its **mirror**.
