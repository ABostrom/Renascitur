# Machinary of Death
The machinery of death. The cogs turn and whur, this is the cycle that ensures the souls in the universe are reincarnated. All souls were created at the dawn of the universe, and when no more souls exist, the animus machina will cease to function, and time and the universe will end.Â 

In the world of Renascitur, the concept of the Machinery of Death represents the intricate system that governs the journey of souls in the afterlife. It is a cosmic mechanism that ensures the cycle of life and death, maintaining balance and allowing for the continuation of existence.

When a living being passes away, their soul is separated from their physical form and enters the Machinery of Death. This metaphysical machinery serves as a conduit, guiding souls through the transition from the mortal realm to the realms beyond. It acts as a bridge between life and death, orchestrating the intricate process of reincarnation or transmigration.

The Machinery of Death is an enigmatic construct, its inner workings hidden from mortal eyes. It is believed to exist in a realm between worlds, an ethereal domain where the souls traverse and undergo a transformative journey. The exact mechanics and purpose of this machinery are shrouded in mystery, known only to those ancient beings who have studied the deepest secrets of the cosmos.

The machinery itself is described as a complex network of celestial energies, ethereal pathways, and cosmic mechanisms. It is said to be governed by cosmic forces and overseen by entities of immense power and wisdom. These guardians of the Machinery of Death ensure that souls are appropriately guided and directed to their destined paths.

The Machinery of Death serves multiple functions beyond the mere passage of souls. It is believed to facilitate the cleansing and rejuvenation of souls, allowing them to shed the burdens and attachments of their previous lives. Through this process, souls are prepared for their next incarnation, their karmic debts balanced, and their spiritual growth nurtured.

The concept of the Machinery of Death is deeply intertwined with the beliefs and mythologies of the various cultures in Renascitur. Different civilizations may have their own interpretations and rituals associated with death and the afterlife, but all acknowledge the existence and significance of this cosmic machinery in some form or another.

In the grand tapestry of Renascitur, the Machinery of Death stands as a fundamental aspect of the universe, a mysterious and essential force that shapes the destiny of souls and ensures the continuous cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It is a concept that evokes both awe and reverence, inviting contemplation of the profound mysteries that lie beyond the mortal realm.
