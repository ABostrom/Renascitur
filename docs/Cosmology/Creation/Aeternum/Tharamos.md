# [[Tharamos]], The Worldforger

## Overview
[[Tharamos]] is the cosmic force of foundation, stability, and endurance. Known as the Unyielding Stone, [[Tharamos]] forged the very bones of existence, crafting the mountains, the bedrock, and the structure upon which all things rest.

He is the master of creation through hardship, believing that all things must be tempered by struggle to reach their full potential. His presence is felt in the anvil's ring, the mountainâ€™s weight, and the slow but unstoppable march of time.

## Role in Creation
- Struck the first hammer blow upon the Void, forging matter from nothingness.
- Created the land, the mountains, and the deep roots of existence.
- Crafted the physical forms of the [[Grundthain]], instilling them with strength and endurance.
- Helped shape the [[Machinery of Death]], ensuring that all things would eventually return to the forge of renewal.

## Link to [[Machinery of Death]]
[[Tharamos]] ensured that [[Soul]]s would not simply vanish into oblivion but would instead be reforged, reshaped, and sent back into the cycle stronger than before. His philosophy is one of endurance through suffering, seeing the trials of existence as the process of refinement.

## Relationship with [[Aeternum|The Aeternum]]
- [[Aelion]] provided light, but [[Tharamos]] gave it form.
- [[Sylara]] softened his rigid designs, ensuring life could flourish within them.
- [[Valtor]] tested his structures, introducing motion and erosion to prevent stagnation.

## The Flaw of [[Ishna]]
To [[Tharamos]], [[Ishna]] is the fracture in an otherwise perfect design. A weakness in the great forging of reality, a flaw that must be reforged or purged. He believes that only through the destruction of the weak and the strengthening of the worthy can the cosmos be restored.

## Worship and Legacy
Among the [[Grundthain]], [[Tharamos]] is honored as the Worldforger and the Eternal Anvil. His teachings are recorded in the [[Iron Codex]], a sacred text written in [[Aetherglyphic]]. His influence can still be seen in the great mountain halls and the unyielding spirit of those who follow the path of the forge.
