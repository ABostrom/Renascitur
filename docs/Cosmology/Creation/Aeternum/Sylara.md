# [[Sylara]], The Verdant Soul

## Overview
[[Sylara]] is the cosmic force of life, growth, and the interwoven spirit of nature. Known as the Verdant Soul, [[Sylara]] shaped the great forests, the rivers, and the interconnected web of all living things.

She is the great weaver, the spirit of balance and renewal. In her presence, all things grow, decay, and return to the earth to begin anew.

## Role in Creation
- Breathed the first life into existence, giving form to the forests and seas.
- Created the [[Kyojin]] to serve as stewards of the natural cycle.
- Wove the [[Machinery of Death]] into the world, ensuring that death was not an end but a transformation.
- Balanced the rigid structures of [[Tharamos]] with the fluidity of life.

## Link to [[Machinery of Death]]
[[Sylara]] viewed the [[Machinery of Death]] as a sacred cycle, one that should not be tampered with. To her, death was never a punishment but a necessary transformation, allowing [[soul]]s to shed their burdens and rejoin the world anew.

## Relationship with [[The Aeternum]]
- [[Aelion]] provided the light for life to grow.
- [[Tharamos]] crafted the land upon which her forests could root.
- [[Valtor]] ensured that life would never stagnate, introducing migration, storms, and adaptation.

## The Flaw of [[Ishna]]
To [[Sylara]], [[Ishna]] is a wound in the cycle, a rot that prevents [[soul]]s from moving forward. The corruption of [[souls]] into aberrations is an abomination that disrupts the natural flow of existence.

## Worship and Legacy
Among the [[Kyojin]], [[Sylara]] is revered as the Spirit Weaver and the Keeper of the Cycle. Her teachings are passed down through the [[Verdant Sutras]], written in [[Natsugen]], the whispering language of nature itself.
