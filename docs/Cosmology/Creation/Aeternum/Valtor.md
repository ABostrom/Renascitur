# [[Valtor|Valtor, The Unfettered Wind]]

## Overview
[[Valtor]] is the cosmic force of change, motion, and the unpredictable flow of existence. Known as the Endless Tide, [[Valtor]] ensures that nothing remains static, setting the world into constant motion.

He is the great storm, the rising tide, the ever-shifting currents of fate. To him, stagnation is death, and only through constant motion can the universe thrive.

## Role in Creation
- Set the planets and stars into motion.
- Created the [[Human]] and gave them the blessing of limitless potential.
- Introduced the concept of uncertainty, allowing fate to be shaped by choice.
- Ensured that the [[Machinery of Death]] would never become predictable or controlled.

## Link to [[Machinery of Death]]
[[Valtor]] introduced the unpredictable nature of [[soul]], allowing them to choose their paths rather than be bound by rigid fate. This unpredictability is what allows true growth and transformation.

## The Flaw of [[Ishna]]
To [[Valtor]], [[Ishna]] is not a flaw, but a consequence. A reminder that even the greatest creations must adapt or perish.

## Worship and Legacy
Among the [[Human|Humans]] [[Valtor]] is seen as the Stormcaller and the Master of Change. His presence is honoured in the shifting winds and the ever-turning wheel of fate.
