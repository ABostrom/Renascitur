# [[Aelion]], The First Dawn

## Overview
[[Aelion]] is the cosmic force of order, illumination, and the celestial cycle. Known as the Everburning Light, [[Aelion]] was the first of The [[Aeternum]] to awaken in the Void, kindling the [[Celestial Flame]] that brought light into existence.

His radiance shaped the heavens, setting the stars in their eternal paths and establishing the laws of [[Creation Story]]. He is the architect of structure and clarity, ensuring that existence follows a divine pattern.

## Role in Creation
- Created the light of the cosmos and established the solar cycles.
- Decreed the Laws of the Universe, which govern the flow of energy, matter, and time.
- Conceived the [[Machinery of Death]], ensuring the eternal return of [[Soul]]s through the cycle of rebirth.
- Bestowed his blessing of longevity upon the [[Solaran]], granting them the wisdom to uphold his order.

## Link to [[Machinery of Death]]
[[Aelion]] played a crucial role in the formation of the [[Machinery of Death]], ensuring that [[Soul]] would not become stagnant but instead progress toward enlightenment. His influence created the concept of cosmic judgment, where the accumulation of [[Luminis]] determines a [[soul]]'s place in the next cycle.

## Relationship with The [[Aeternum]]
- [[Tharamos]] tempered the light of [[Aelion]] with form and foundation.
- [[Sylara]] ensured that light was balanced by life, so existence would not be a barren void.
- [[Valtor]] introduced motion and change, preventing [[Aelion]]'s laws from becoming static.

## The Flaw of [[Ishna]]
Despite his wisdom, [[Aelion]] did not perceive the shadow hidden within his own light. It was within his cosmic illumination that [[Ishna]] first took form, a flaw woven into [[Creation Story]] itself. His failure to account for entropy led to the corruption that now spreads across existence.

## Worship and Legacy
Among the [[Solaran]], [[Aelion]] is revered as the First Light and the Eternal Guide. His ancient teachings are preserved in the [[Lex Solara]], a collection of celestial laws written in the language of [[Luxan]]. Some sects believe that rekindling the [[Celestial Flame]] could undo the flaw of [[Ishna]] and restore the perfection of the original cycle.
