**The Elder Races and Their Connection to the Aeternum and the Three World Trees**

The Elder Races were the first mortal civilizations shaped by the divine forces of the **Four Aeternum**: [[Aelion]], [[Tharamos]], [[Sylara]], and [[Valtor*]] Each race was chosen and blessed by one of these primordial forces, forming the foundation of the world's ancient history. Their destinies became intertwined with the Three World Trees, each representing a different pillar of existence.


### **The [[Solaran]]s: Chosen of [[Aelion]]**

**Blessing:** Longevity, mastery of light and celestial energy  
**Aeternum Patron:** [[Aelion]], The Everburning Light  
**World Tree Connection:** **[[Irisandra]], the Solaran Tree** (Knowledge and Understanding)

The **Solarans** were the first and greatest civilization of the First Age, chosen by **Aelion** to be the bearers of wisdom, innovation, and celestial power. Their mastery over **solar energy** and arcane technology allowed them to build vast cities that touched the stars. However, their ambition led to the creation of the **Endless Sun**, a failed attempt to restore the celestial order after Ishna’s corruption of the **Primal Forces**.

Their connection to **Irasandra**, the **Tree of Knowledge**, symbolized their endless pursuit of enlightenment. When their civilization fell, Irasandra endured, merging with **Iris Andras**, a Solaran scientist who became the immortal guardian of the tree.

Though their empire is gone, remnants of the Solarans remain scattered throughout the world—some hiding in the ruins of their lost cities, others living among the High Elves, still carrying the flickering embers of their once-glorious knowledge.


### **The [[Grundthain]]: Chosen of [[Tharamos]]**

**Blessing:** Might, endurance, mastery of stone and metal  
**Aeternum Patron:** [[Tharamos]], The Unyielding Stone  
**World Tree Connection:** **The Grundthain Tree** (Power and Primal Forces)

Before the divergence of dwarves and giants, the **Grundthain** were a single people, mighty beings who shaped the mountains and forged the world’s foundations. Tharamos, the **Aeternum of Earth**, blessed them with resilience, strength, and a deep bond with the elements.

The **Grundthain Tree** was the source of **Aetherglyphs**, the runes that formed the original language of the universe. It was from this tree that the first **Runesmiths** learned how to inscribe reality itself into stone and metal. The **Dwarves** inherited this tradition when Muradin led his people into the depths to forge **Runehart**, while the **Giants** scattered, each clan binding itself to one of the Four Great Elementals:

- **[[Leviathan]]** (Frost and Sea)
    
- **[[Phenos]]** (Fire and Mountain)
    
- **[[Tempus]]** (Cloud and Storm)
    
- **[[Zaratan]]** (Stone and Hill)
    

The destruction of **[[Runehart]]** marked the end of the [[Grundthain]] as a united race, but their legacy remains in **[[The Codex of Iron]], the lost fragments of Muradin’s teachings.


### **The [[Kyojin]]: Chosen of [[Sylara]]**

**Blessing:** Connection to spirit, mastery of the cycle of life and death  
**Aeternum Patron:** [[Sylara]], The Verdant Soul  
**World Tree Connection:** **The Kyojin Tree** (Spirit and Harmony)

The **Kyojin**, ancestors of the orcs, were the most spiritually attuned of the Elder Races. Chosen by **Sylara**, the **Aeternum of the Forest**, they understood the cycle of life and death better than any other race. Their **shamanistic traditions** allowed them to walk between the physical and spiritual realms, acting as **stewards of the soul cycle**.

The **Kyojin Tree** was their sacred anchor, binding them to the natural flow of existence. Through its roots, the spirits of the dead could return to the earth, and from its branches, new souls were born.

Their devotion to the balance of life led them to clash with those who sought to pervert death—namely **[[Vecna]]**, who sought to replace the broken **[[Machinery of Death]]** with his own dominion. The fall of the [[Kyojin]] civilization left the world vulnerable to the spread of undeath, and over time, their descendants—the orcs—lost much of their ancient wisdom. Yet, deep within the spiritual heartlands of their people, the last of the **[[Kyojin]] Shamans** still whisper the old songs of the Verdant Soul.


### **The [[Human]]s: Chosen of [[Valtor]]**

**Blessing:** Potential, adaptability, boundless ambition  
**Aeternum Patron:** [[Valtor]], The Endless Tide  
**World Tree Connection:** None directly, but influenced by all

Unlike the other Elder Races, **Humans** were not bound to a single tree or a single path. Instead, **[[Valtor]], the Aeternum of Change**, granted them **potential**—the ability to shape their own destinies, for better or worse. They did not have the longevity of the Solarans, the endurance of the Grundthain, or the spiritual attunement of the Kyojin, but they possessed the ability to grow beyond their limitations.

This blessing made humans both **versatile and dangerous**. They adapted quickly, learning from the ruins of fallen civilizations and shaping new empires upon their bones. They became **kings, conquerors, scholars, and savages**—a race that could rise to celestial heights or fall into ruin, dictated only by their own choices.

Many of the greatest champions, tyrants, and ascended deities of later ages were human, their fates shaped not by divine decree but by their own actions. Some say that Valtor never intended to choose a people, only to **set the tides in motion and let them find their own way**.
