# [[Aeternum]], The Cosmic Architects

## Overview
[[Aeternum]] are the primordial cosmic forces that shaped existence itself. They are not gods but the architects of reality, each embodying a fundamental aspect of creation. It was through their combined will that the universe, the stars, and the [[Machinery of Death]] were forged. Their design was meant to be perfect, yet within it, an unseen flaw emerged—[[Ishna]], the unraveling force of entropy.

## The Four Cosmic Architects
### [[Aelion]], The First Dawn
- The force of **order, illumination, and the celestial cycle**.
- Kindled the [[Celestial Flame]], bringing light into the void.
- Established the **Laws of the Universe**, ensuring structure and purpose.
- Created the [[Solaran]], who were gifted with **longevity** and wisdom.
- Conceived the [[Machinery of Death]] to guide [[Soul]] toward enlightenment.
- Did not foresee that within his radiance, the first shadow of [[Ishna]] was cast.

### [[Tharamos]], The Worldforger
- The force of **foundation, stability, and endurance**.
- Struck the **first hammer blow upon the Void**, forging the physical world.
- Crafted the mountains, the bedrock, and the deep roots of existence.
- Created the [[Grundthain]], instilling them with **strength and resilience**.
- Ensured that [[Soul]] would be **tempered and reforged** through the [[Machinery of Death]].
- Believes that [[Ishna]] is a flaw to be reforged, that only the strong will endure.

### [[Sylara]], The Verdant Soul
- The force of **life, growth, and the interwoven cycle of existence**.
- Wove the **Cycle of Rebirth**, ensuring that all things return to the earth.
- Created the great forests, rivers, and the interconnected web of life.
- Gave rise to the [[Kyojin]], the stewards of the natural order.
- Integrated the [[Machinery of Death]] as a means of renewal, where death was not an end but a transformation.
- Sees [[Ishna]] as a wound in the cycle, a corruption that must be purified.

### [[Valtor]], The Unfettered Wind
- The force of **change, motion, and the unpredictable flow of existence**.
- Ensured that no creation would remain static, setting the tides and stars into motion.
- Created the [[Human]]s, gifting them with **potential and free will**.
- Introduced fate and uncertainty, allowing souls to choose their own paths.
- Ensured that the [[Machinery of Death]] would never become predictable or controlled.
- Sees [[Ishna]] not as a flaw, but as the **consequence of stagnation**, a force that must be confronted with adaptation.

## The Creation of the [[Machinery of Death]]
Together, [[Aeternum]] forged the **finite number of [[Soul]]** that would exist across all cycles of creation. These souls were bound to the **great cosmic mechanism**, the [[Machinery of Death]], through which they would **experience life, accumulate [[Luminis]], and ascend** through countless rebirths.

Once a sufficient number of [[Soul]] had achieved enlightenment, the **universe itself would be reborn**, beginning a new cycle of existence. This was their grand design—a universe that **grew, transformed, and ultimately renewed itself through the wisdom gained in each cycle**.

Yet, this perfection was not to last.

## The Flaw of [[Ishna]]
Though each of [[Aeternum]] played a role in crafting the cosmos, **they did not see the flaw in their design**. Within **Aelion’s light**, a shadow took root. Within **Tharamos’ structure**, a fracture formed. Within **Sylara’s cycle**, a stagnation appeared. Within **Valtor’s motion**, chaos whispered.

From this unseen flaw, [[Ishna]] emerged—not a creator, but a devourer. She was the **entropy that gnawed at the edges of existence**, the corruption that twisted [[Soul]] into **aberrations**, breaking the cycle and halting the path to enlightenment.

The corruption of the [[Machinery of Death]] is now accelerating. As fewer [[Soul]] complete their journey, the cosmic balance falters. If left unchecked, the universe will stagnate, unable to renew itself. The grand design of [[Aeternum]], once flawless, now stands on the brink of collapse.

## The Perspectives of the [[Elder Races]]
The four elder races, each created by one of [[Aeternum]], interpret their creators and the cosmic flaw differently:

- The [[Solaran]]'s seek to **erase the flaw** and restore the **perfect order of the past**.
- The [[Grundthain]] believe **only the strong will endure**, reforging the world to be unbreakable.
- The [[Kyojin]] believe in **purifying the cycle**, guiding corrupted [[Soul]] back to their path.
- The [[Human]]'s accept **change as inevitable**, believing that the cosmos must adapt or perish.
