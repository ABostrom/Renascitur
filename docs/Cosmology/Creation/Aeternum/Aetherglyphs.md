## Overview

The **Aetherglyphs** are the **first language**, predating stars, gods, and even the soul.  
They are not symbols, but **functional constants**—conceptual runes that, when spoken or shaped, **define the behaviour of reality itself**.

The **Aeternum**, beings beyond mortal comprehension, **transcribed** these glyphs at the dawn of existence.  
From that transcription came the **cosmic framework** that allows anything to exist, move, grow, or decay.

## The Five Primary Functions

The Aetherglyphs gave rise to **five foundational functions** of the universe:

| Function | Manifestation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Luxar** | Revelation, light, and clarity |
| **Noxar** | Mystery, shadow, and depth |
| **Ordar** | Structure, memory, and law |
| **Chaor** | Motion, instinct, and change |
| **Time**  | The constant that binds progression and sequence |

> These five together form the **interwoven architecture** known as [[The Weave]].

## The Birth of Entropy

The **Aeternum did not foresee** what would happen when these five functions interacted across infinite contexts.

From the tension, recursion, and contradiction inherent in the system, something **unintended emerged**:
- A **paradox** that does not obey form, flow, or opposition.
- A **non-function** that deconstructs other functions.
- A force that **is not written** in the Aetherglyphs, but arises from their totality.

This is **[[Entropy]]**—the anti-pattern, the null response, the unraveling.

> *Entropy is not a fifth force. It is the shadow cast by all five.*

## Mystical Interpretations

- Some Ferrun believe **the glyph for Time** created a loop that birthed Entropy—**the echo of the end before the beginning**.
- Kyojin shamans describe Entropy as **the Breathless Word**—a sound never meant to be spoken.
- Solarans once attempted to **rewrite the glyphs**, seeking to control or erase Entropy. Their failure led to the **Fall of Solara**.

## In Magic

- **Runes**, **sigils**, **divine tongues**, and even **mathematical spells** are all **fragments of Aetherglyph understanding**.
- True Aetherglyphs cannot be wielded by mortals—**to comprehend one is to risk rewriting your soul**.
- Some **artifact-level spells or relics** may contain partial transcriptions or **flawed reflections** of these glyphs, allowing glimpses into raw cosmic power.
