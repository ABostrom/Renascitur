## The [[Aeternum]] and the [[Machinery of Death]]

_(A Creation Myth as Told by the [[Elder Races]] of Renascitur)_

---

### **Before Time, Before Form**

Before the first dawn, before the mountains rose, before even the winds stirred the oceans, there was the **Void**—endless, silent, without memory or purpose. It was within this abyss that the **[[Aeternum]]** awoke—beings of infinite design, bound not by time, but by the will to create.

Each of them was an architect of reality, shaping the universe in accordance with their nature:

- [[Aelion]], The First Dawn brought forth **light** and **order**, kindling the **Celestial Flame** that would illuminate the cosmos.
- [[Tharamos]], The Worldforger, struck the **Anvil of Creation**, crafting the firmament, the mountains, and the foundations upon which all things would stand.
- [[Sylara]], The Verdant [[Soul]], wove the tapestry of **life**, entwining existence with the Cycle—the endless dance of birth, death, and rebirth.
- [[Valtor]], The Unfettered Wind, stirred the cosmos into motion, setting the tides of fate in motion, ensuring that no creation remained stagnant.

But creation alone was not enough. A world of stone, of light, of breath, of motion—these were but empty shells without purpose.

Thus, in their wisdom, [[Aeternum|the Aeternum]] forged the **Souls**. Finite in number, yet infinite in potential, these radiant embers were cast into existence, each imbued with the power to experience, to grow, to change.

It was [[Sylara]] who spoke first: _“They must move with the Cycle, forever returning, forever learning.”_  
And [[Tharamos]] said: _“They must be tested, tempered like steel upon the anvil of existence.”_  
And [[Aelion]] decreed: _“They must be judged by the weight of their deeds.”_  
And [[Valtor]] whispered: _“They must never stand still, lest they fall to ruin.”_

And so, [[Machinery of Death]] was wrought—a vast and intricate design spanning the planes of existence, through which each [[soul]] would **transmigrate** across lifetimes, gathering knowledge, experience, and **[[Luminis]]**—the divine weight of their choices.

With each passing life, a [[soul]] would carry forth its essence, shaped by rials and tribulations, victories and failures, kindness and cruelty. Those who gathered enough [[Luminis]] would ascend, becoming part of the great cosmic renewal, ensuring that when the universe had reached its final cycle, all would be reborn anew.

This was the grand design, the perfect system that would sustain eternity itself.

### **The Flaw in the Design**

But perfection is an illusion. Even [[Aeternum]], for all their wisdom, could not see the shadow that had taken root within their creation.

For **within the light of [[Aelion]], there was darkness**.  
Within the **strength of [[Tharamos]], there was rigidity**.  
Within the **cycle of [[Sylara]], there was stagnation**.  
Within the **winds of [[Valtor]], there was chaos**.

From this flaw, **[[Ishna]]** was born. Not a creator, not a force of balance, but **a devourer, an unraveling, the entropy that gnaws at the edges of all things.**

[[Ishna]] whispered to the souls as they passed through the great cycle. _Why struggle? Why return? Why not take, consume, control?_

Those who **listened** became something else—twisted, malformed, refusing to let go of what they had been. They became **[[Aberrations]]**, souls that no longer moved with the Cycle, but instead **fed upon it, corrupting all they touched.**

The Machinery of Souls, once a seamless cycle of **growth and renewal**, **began to falter**. Fewer and fewer souls completed their journey. The weight of the corrupted souls dragged upon the cosmic order, clogging the great gears of existence.

Without enough **[[Luminis]]**, the universe could no longer be reborn.

The great plan of [[Aeternum|the Aeternum]], once a perfect mechanism, **was breaking.**

### **The Four Races and Their Truths**

The [[Elder Races]], created as **stewards of existence**, each tell the story in their own way.

- **The [[Solaran|Solarans]]** say that _[[Ishna]] was a mistake_—a flaw that must be corrected, erased. They seek to **reignite the Endless Sun**, to banish darkness forever. Yet in their arrogance, they have **forgotten that fire consumes as easily as it warms**.
- **The [[Grundthain]]** say that _the forge must be reforged_—that only through **unmaking and remaking** can the world be **restored**. Yet they do not see that their hammer **shatters as much as it shapes**.
- **The [[Kyojin]]** say that _balance must be restored_—that **[[aberrations]] must be purified**, their spirits guided back to the Cycle. Yet even they struggle with the truth that **some souls do not wish to return**.
- **The Humans**, the ever-changing, claim that _[[Ishna]] is neither flaw nor corruption, but consequence_—that the universe must **change or die**, that to resist is to **cling to the past**. And yet, even they do not see the full shape of what is to come.

Thus, the races of the world do not stand united in purpose. Some **seek to preserve**, others **to rebuild**, others **to cleanse**, and others **to move forward**.

But **one truth remains**:

**If the Machinery of Souls fails completely, the Cycle will end. And with it, the universe itself.**

What happens next is unknown. Even [[Aeternum|the Aeternum]], in all their wisdom, **do not know what lies beyond the breaking of the Cycle**.

Perhaps it will be oblivion.

Perhaps it will be something far worse.
