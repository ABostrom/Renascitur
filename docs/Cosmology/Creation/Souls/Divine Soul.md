The divine [[soul]] is someone who is descended from the sacred line of [[Solaran]] society.Â 

When divine souls die their [[soul]] does not enter the [[machinery of death]] - instead they manifest as souls that can bond with another living being. In ancient [[Solaran]] society the Ba Ntr were revered and to be bonded with one's ancestors was a great privilege.
