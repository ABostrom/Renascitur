Entropy is **not one of the four forces**. It is their **undoing**.

It is not shadow, nor chaos, nor death. It is the end of pattern. The silence after all stories. The rot that does not hunger—it simply *is*.

Where the Four Forces create tension, motion, form, and growth, **Entropy erodes**. It does not oppose **one** force—it **opposes The Weave itself**, unravelling the harmony that sustains all life and reality.

## Symbols
- A cracked ring consuming itself.
- A blank circle or static void.
## In Opposition
Entropy cannot be killed—only **resisted** through balance, creation, and memory.

> *The moment you forget why the world matters… it begins to fray.*

## The Anti-Structure

[[Entropy]] is not part of [[The Weave]].  
It is the **anomalous consequence** of the Five interacting within the Weave’s conceptual boundaries.  
It is not shadow, nor chaos—it is **nullification**.  

Where the Weave gives rise to meaning, **Entropy unravels meaning**.  
It is the **collapse of pattern, relation, and identity**, not by opposition—but by negation.

> Entropy is not the dark side of the Weave.  
> It is the space where the Weave does not—and cannot—exist.
