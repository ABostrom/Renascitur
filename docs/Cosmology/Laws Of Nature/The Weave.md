**Nature**: The foundational structure of reality—like the fabric of spacetime  
**Created By**: The [[Aeternum]], using the [[Aetherglyphs]]  
**Composed Of**: The four cosmic forces ([[Luxar]], [[Noxar]], [[Ordar]], [[Chaor]]) + [[Time]]  
**Opposed By**: [[Entropy]], the anomaly  
**Role**: The universal substrate that governs existence, consciousness, motion, and meaning

## Overview

**The Weave** is not a lattice, nor a net, nor something one "touches."  
It is the **underlying metaphysical structure** of the universe—**the reality-field** into which all planes, forces, souls, and thoughts are inscribed.

Much like how physicists in later ages will refer to the *fabric of spacetime*, the Weave is a **conceptual framework**, created when the primordial beings known as the [[Aeternum]] transcribed the [[Aetherglyphs]]—the source-code functions of the universe—into existence.

The result was a stable, harmonious framework upon which **everything else could be layered**:  
- Planes  
- Souls  
- Thought  
- Matter  
- Motion  
- Magic  
- Memory

## How the Weave Was Made

The Weave was formed from the interplay of **five glyphic forces**:

| Force | Function |
|-------|----------|
| [[Luxar]] | Illumination, clarity, revelation |
| [[Noxar]] | Mystery, concealment, potential |
| [[Ordar]] | Structure, memory, continuity |
| [[Chaor]] | Instinct, change, spontaneity |
| **Time** | The universal constant that sequences all things |

The Weave is the **logical container** that allows:
- Time to pass  
- Energy to move  
- Souls to retain continuity  
- Magic to express consistent outcomes  
- Meaning to exist  

All systems—physical, magical, or spiritual—are **possibilities that emerge within the Weave**.
