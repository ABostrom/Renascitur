Luxar is the **force of light**, representing **truth revealed, purpose clarified**, and the radiance of conscious understanding. It is not purely benevolentâ€”light can blind, expose, or burn. But it brings shape to shadow and gives direction to the lost.

Luxar is woven into the very fabric of the cosmos, acting in tension with [[Noxar]] to form part of the balance known as [[the Weave]].

## Symbols
- A blazing sun with a hollow center.
- An open eye within a star.

## Cultural Notes
- **Solarans** revered Luxar as part of their dual legacy with [[Noxar]].
- In the [[Firebrand Empire]], Luxar is interpreted as the **Divine Purpose** that drives noble conquest.

## In Opposition
Luxar without balance leads to **dogma**, **purity crusades**, and **righteous tyranny**.
