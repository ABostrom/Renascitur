The god unborn could twist and contort the souls of mortals into unnatural aberrations.

These creations took on a twisted, cruel imitation of life. Devoid of emotion, and the Lux that gives mortals their essence.

Some Aberrations were cold, calculating and entered into uneasy pacts with their maker, others were nothing more than mindless servants, just extensions of their maker's will.

[[Vecna]] reached out into the stars and saw glimpses of the destruction the God Unborn was reeking across the cosmos. Realising it was only a matter of time before his sights were set on his world (Oerth) he forged a pact with his friend Kasabian, and sought to protect their world. Realising the power that the God unborn could wield, and the manner in which he was corrupting mortal life. Vecna aided and built enormous war machines using arcanometry to battle the Aberrations. He built great machines that would house mortals, giving them the strength of 10 men, and the fire power of a highly trained wizard. This was not enough. They could stem the tide of the onslaught and gain respite. But year on year, more souls would be destroyed and more lives lost. The most prominent of which was his son, [[Hephaestus]].

The losses weighed heavy on his mind, and Vecna began to experiment with Necromancy and Soul magic. Vecna sought for a way to prevent his son from becoming that which all Oerthians had sworn to destroy. Vecna, experimenting with himself and his son, discovered the secret to immortality. He bound his soul to a phylactery and became a Lich.

With the absence of a body, Vecna could not resurrect his son, instead he chose to bind him to a soul kristal [[Nox Lapis]] and house him in a machine of war. [[Hephaestus]] became the first of the [[Forgeborn]]  and this signalled the turning point in the Last War.

With an army of immortal steel warriors, and those whose souls could not be bound would soon be reborn again as the undead. Vecna realised those whose souls were already claimed by Noxarian magic can not be corrupted by [[Ishna]]

“For only the light can be consumed by the shadows” – [[Vecna]]

“Only those who are trapped in the darkness can truly appreciate the light” – [[Hephaestus]].  

 [[Vecna]] summoned his war council, some of whom could not comprehend what he had done to himself. [[Kasabian]], his most trusted general and friend, at first was horrified, he spoke with Vecna and was vehemently against the trajectory the war effort was going, Vecna forged for Kas a Necro sword of immense power, which he presented to Kas. Feeling the blade in his hands, the weight of the task ahead weighed heavily on his mind. The sword hungered for the souls of the fallen, even those twisted into aberrations.

Eventually the army of flesh and steel drove back [[Ishna]]'s assault. Unrelenting, [[Vecna]] pressed on, consumed in his 1000 year war to rid the Universe of [[Ishna]] he could not stop. He pursued [[Ishna]]' forces across the cosmos. Eventually devising a plan to seal her away.

[[Vecna]] presented his plan to the war council again. Vecna revealed that in order to construct the hexweave pylons, each pylon would need the souls of a billion mortals on every world. Not enough to render a world devoid of life, but a serious toll on its inhabitants. Vecna argued that inorder to save trillions, they must kill billions. This level of sacrifice was a hefty toll. The council argued for weeks and deliberated. Vecna assured them all there was no other way. 

Kasabian had grown weary, his trust in Vecna wavering. He stormed off in a rage vowing to Vecna that he had gone too far. “You are not a god, this is not your decision to make”. “Some prices are too steep, there must be a better way”.

He constructed the Hexweave pylons – large [Soul Kristals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17UBeTKd3Fl4TwHLNa-uxBUu0vXz8Ud6m6s0cmIC5HpY/edit#heading=h.sw19c2sw9u3o) born from the sacrifices of all mortals within that realm.

The plan was set, all 6 hexweave pylons would need to be activated at once. Haephestus would guard the forge of souls, during the final assault as a fail safe. 

The god unborn was sealed in the space between planes – where his power was diminished and the Hexweave pylons could contain his essence and prevent him from impacting the mortal worlds again.

The god unborn’s servants staged a retaliatory assault on the forge of souls, hoping to learn the locations of the pylons, and undo the binding of their master. A large force of aberrations and bound [[Slaad|Slaads]] made their way into the forge and destroyed a large proportion of the machinery. Vecna managed to arrive in the nick of time, and save his son from certain death. It was in this moment of weakness [[Kasabian]] struck, killing Vecna and finishing off his son. 

Many of his worshippers came and went. Seeking to release the god unborn and bring about his return. All failed. Vecna’s undead servants bound to the mortal realm through necromantic magic have sought to protect humanity from his agents ([[Souls of the Devourer|The Souls of the Devourer]]). To them, the unending oblivion [[Ishna]] offers is all they seek.

“What is darkness, but the absence of light” – Vecna

When the world was reformed after the release of the God Unborn from his imprisonment, the universe and the balance of power shifted. Once, the world was a balanced mix of light and shadow. Now it is wreathed in eternal darkness, whilst the last flickers of light are dying out.
