# God of Knowledge, The Weaver

Dorian is revered as the god of knowledge, wisdom, and magic. He is the patron deity of scholars, wizards, and seekers of arcane lore. Dorian is often depicted as a mysterious, contemplative figure with a book or a wand in his hand.Â 

Dorian, the Weaver, is the god of knowledge and magic. He was once a mortal wizard who sought to uncover the secrets of the universe. In his quest for knowledge, he stumbled upon an ancient text that revealed the inner workings of the weave, the magical energy that flows through all things.

With this newfound knowledge, Dorian ascended to godhood and became the custodian of the weave itself. He is known as the Weaver because he has the power to shape and manipulate the weave to his will.

As the god of knowledge, Dorian values learning and discovery above all else. He is often depicted holding a book or scroll, symbolising his endless pursuit of knowledge. He is also associated with magic and spell craft, and many wizards and sorcerers call upon his name when casting spells.

Despite his vast knowledge and power, Dorian is a relatively reclusive god. He prefers to observe and learn from a distance rather than intervene in the affairs of mortals. However, when the balance of magic is threatened, he will not hesitate to take action to preserve it.

Dorian is also the patron deity of the city of Arcanum, which is known throughout the land for its renowned magical academy. The wizards and sorcerers of Arcanum offer prayers and sacrifices to Dorian in exchange for his blessings and guidance.

He resides in the realm of [[Sigmora]]
