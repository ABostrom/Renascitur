In the cosmology of Renascitur, the beginning of time sees the creation of a finite number of [[souls]]. These souls embark on a cyclical journey, guided by the intricate machinery of death. The purpose of this machinery is to facilitate the transmigration of souls, enabling them to accumulate experiences and [[Luminis]] throughout their countless lifetimes.

As the souls progress through their individual journeys, facing trials and tribulations, they gather wisdom and grow spiritually. It is through the accumulation of Luminis, the manifestation of their actions and intentions, that these souls become charged with divine energy. The machinery of death plays a crucial role in this process, facilitating the movement and evolution of souls as they traverse various realms and planes of existence.

Once a significant number of souls have reached a state of karmic charge, the universe has completed its cycle. This marks a moment of profound significance, as the collective energy and wisdom of the charged souls contribute to the rejuvenation and renewal of the cosmos. The universe then begins anew, with fresh possibilities and untold potential for the next cycle of creation and growth.

The concept of the machinery of death in Renascitur reflects the interconnectedness of [[souls]], [[Luminis]], and the cosmic cycle. It emphasizes the importance of spiritual evolution and the eventual culmination of the journey toward enlightenment. It is through this intricate and profound system that the universe sustains its rhythm and balance, perpetuating the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

In the vast and complex cycle of the universe, balance is paramount. However, in the world of Renascitur, a great disturbance has emerged. The corruption of souls into aberrations has thrown this delicate equilibrium into disarray, hindering the natural process of souls becoming karmically charged.

Aberrations, twisted and malformed manifestations of once-vibrant [[Souls#Aberrant Souls|Souls]], have succumbed to the darkness and veered from the path of spiritual growth. They embody the consequences of negative actions, unresolved emotions, and the distortion of the cosmic energies that should propel souls forward on their journey of enlightenment.

As these aberrations proliferate and hinder the transmigration of souls, the number of karmically charged souls diminishes. The natural flow of the machinery of death, once a harmonious and perpetual cycle, now faces disruption and stagnation. Without a sufficient influx of charged souls to rejuvenate the universe, the cosmic cycle itself begins to falter.

The implications of this disruption are far-reaching. It affects not only the balance of the universe but also the fate of all living beings. The scarcity of karmically charged souls threatens the sustenance of cosmic energies and the potential for renewal and rebirth. The corruption of souls into aberrations stands as a significant obstacle, obstructing the inherent order and purpose of the machinery of death.

In the face of this dire situation, heroes and champions must rise to confront the aberrant forces and restore the integrity of the cosmic cycle. Their quest becomes one of vital importance, as they strive to cleanse the corrupted souls, dispel the taint of aberration, and rekindle the path toward enlightenment. Only by purifying and redeeming these wayward souls can the machinery of death regain its balance and ensure the continuity of the cosmic cycle.
