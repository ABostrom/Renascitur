1. **Capture and Enslavement**:
    
    - Upon entering [[Thelassia]], the players are captured by the city’s guards, accused of trespassing or being spies from the surface.
    - They are taken to the Ironclad Arena and informed that, as outsiders, they must prove their worth to earn freedom and citizenship.
2. **The Council’s Verdict**:
    
    - The **Council of Sparks** declares that the players must participate in a **Trial by Steel**—a series of gladiatorial challenges to demonstrate their resourcefulness and resolve.
    - The Council sees this as both a punishment and an opportunity to test the outsiders’ capabilities.
