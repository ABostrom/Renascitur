**Qethusiyya** is a continent of sweeping contrasts — blistering desert plains, lush river deltas, and coastal cities forged in the aftermath of Solaran collapse. The ancient city of [[Solara]] still casts its long shadow over [[Eltabarr]] and [[Thelassia]], while the fractured empires of [[Thraysia]] and [[Vasir]] vie for dominance across windswept trade routes.

The [[Kaldar Range]] and [[Ravenspine Cliffs]] shape the continent’s arid interior, where [[Ferrun]] outposts and [[Arcanii]] sanctuaries cling to shaded ridges. Rivers such as the [[River Muzahir]] and [[Sul Vahir]] breathe life into desert-bound cities and ancient [[Solaran]] ruins alike, sustaining the enduring presence of the [[Velastri]] and the far-wandering [[Rahalan]] clans.
