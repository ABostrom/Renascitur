Beneath the shadowed canopies of the Forgotten Forest, near the southern borders of Eltabarr, stand the Obsidian Obelisks of Keth. Shrouded in mystery and pulsating with an almost tangible aura of ancient magic, these monoliths are believed to be remnants of a civilization that predated even the earliest records of known history. Recent explorations led by the [[Eclipsed Civilisations Initiative|Eclipsed Civilizations]] Initiative ([[Eclipsed Civilisations Initiative|ECI]]) have unearthed connections to the obscure practice of Arcanometry—a form of magic that manipulates the very fabric of arcane energy.

### Overview

The Obsidian Obelisks are a series of towering spires, carved from black obsidian that absorbs light and radiates a foreboding energy. Their surfaces are inscribed with glyphs and symbols that defy understanding, resonating with the power of dark ancient magic. These relics of Keth are said to be imbued with the knowledge and power of Arcanometry, a sophisticated and arcane science that seeks to measure, understand, and manipulate the fundamental laws of magic.

### Arcanometry: The Forbidden Study

[[Arcanometry]], as deciphered from the inscriptions on the Obelisks, appears to have been a highly advanced and potentially dangerous field of study. It involved the quantification of magical energies, the creation of arcane formulas capable of altering magical phenomena, and perhaps most alarmingly, the manipulation of the barriers between realms. The civilization of Keth, thus, might have possessed the ability to tap into and control forces that contemporary scholars can barely fathom.

### Dark Ancient Magic

The magic associated with the Obsidian Obelisks and the practice of [[Arcanometry]] is imbued with a potency and depth that borders on the forbidden. The energy emanating from the Obelisks suggests that Keth's magicians were adept in using this dark ancient magic for purposes that remain unclear but hint at significant power and knowledge. The very atmosphere around the Obelisks thrums with an energy that feels both enticing and dangerous, a siren call to those who seek to uncover the deepest secrets of the arcane.

### The Connection to Arcanometry

Investigations by Professor Arthur Denison and his team have revealed that the Obsidian Obelisks served not only as monumental testaments to the Keth civilization's achievements in magic but also as focal points for the practice of Arcanometry. It is theorized that these structures acted as both conduits and amplifiers for magical energy, playing a crucial role in the civilization's ability to perform feats of magic that would be considered impossible today.

### Implications for Magical Scholarship

The discovery of the Obsidian Obelisks of Keth and their connection to Arcanometry has sent ripples through the academic and magical communities of Eltabarr. The potential to unlock new forms of magic, to understand the underlying principles of arcane energy, and to explore the possibilities of realm manipulation offers both tremendous opportunities and significant risks. Scholars at the Athenaeum of Arcane Arts and Sciences are proceeding with caution, aware that the secrets held by the Obsidian Obelisks could redefine the boundaries of magical science or unleash forces that cannot be controlled.

### The Path Forward

The exploration of the Obsidian Obelisks and the study of Arcanometry continue under the auspices of the [[Eclipsed Civilisations Initiative|Eclipsed Civilizations]] Initiative. With each piece of the puzzle that is uncovered, the legacy of Keth grows more intriguing, offering a glimpse into a past where magic operated under different rules, governed by the arcane science of Arcanometry. The journey to unravel these mysteries is fraught with challenges, but for those who tread the path, the rewards—a deeper understanding of magic and its possibilities—promise to be unparalleled.
