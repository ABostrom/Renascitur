## The Grundthain World Tree – The Tree of Power  

### First Age Name: [[Dürrenholt]] (*The Eternal Pine*)  
### Third Age Name: [[Dürrenholt|Wyrmholt]](*The Bastion of Giants*)  

### Overview  
[[Dürrenholt]], meaning "Eternal Pine," was planted by [[Tharamos]] to serve as the **anchor of stability** for the world. Towering over the **glacial valleys of Arcturia**, it is a colossal, frost-kissed pine, its blackened bark covered in glowing **[[Aetherglyphs]]**. The tree is a **sacred site for both giants and dwarves**, a reminder of their shared past before the sundering of the [[Grundthain]].

By the Third Age, it became known as [[Dürrenholt|Wyrmholt]], named after the legends of **titanic dragons** slumbering beneath its roots. The Uftine Dwarves still **carve runestones from its fallen branches**, believing them to contain the first **Runic Script**.

- **Location:** Hidden in a frozen valley in northern [[Arcturia]].  

### Legacy  
- **The First Runewrights** learned from its bark, carving the first [[Aetherglyph]].  
- The [[Dwarf#Uftine Icebreakers Uftine Dwarves|Uftine Dwarves]] believe it holds the last remnant of **[[Muradin]]'s Voice**.  
- **The Skybound Giants** conduct rituals beneath it, believing it holds the spirits of their ancestors.
