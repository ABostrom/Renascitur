## Overview

Uftine is the glacial capital of the [[Icebound]], a dwarven city-state carved from stone and ice deep in the northern reaches of the world. Built into a frozen mountainside and fortified by nature itself, Uftine is a bastion of cold precision, ancestral duty, and unbreakable engineering.

The city is lit by ice-embedded glowcrystals, its buildings carved with runes of frost and stability. Despite the endless winter beyond its walls, Uftine thrives through mastery of rune-bound [[Iceforging]], powerful frost-infused forges, and a culture of unshakable resilience.

Beneath its icy foundations lies the [[The Pulsecore|Pulsecore]], a sealed chamber containing the corrupted progeny of [[Zaratan]], the Great Elemental of Stone. This ancient burden, entombed by [[Muradin]], pulses faintly beneath the city—unseen by most, but felt in the stillness of the air and the weight of its silence.

Each dwarven city was founded over such a prison, and each holds vigil over a corrupted fragment of a Great Elemental. These corrupted cores, too dangerous to destroy, were carved away and sealed so the world might endure. Uftine is both sanctuary and seal.


## Locations of Note

- [[Crystalward Gate]] – Main entrance to the city, guarded by rune-powered frost engines  

## Relations

- View the [[Draumhavn|Tidebound]] of [[Draumhavn]] as bold but reckless
- Respect the silence of [[Magnus’ Rest]], though find them overly insular
- Collaborate closely with [[Thundrakar]] on rune engineering, though debate philosophy
