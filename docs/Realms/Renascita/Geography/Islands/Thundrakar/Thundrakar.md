## Overview  
[[Thundrakar]] is the mountain city of the [[Stormbound]], carved into and around the base of the colossal [[Stormspire]] — the tallest peak in the world. Here, the dwarves live suspended between earth and sky — their towers crowned with lightning rods and their halls echoing with the voice of the storm.

Bridges arc between peaks. Wind tunnels sing through open-arched halls. The air is always charged, the sky never still.

## Cultural Theme  
The [[Stormbound]] are not architects of dominion, but custodians of resonance. They believe **memory rides the thunder** and dedicate their lives to listening, recording, and transcribing the will of the storm.

They shape runes not to control lightning, but to **honor its message**. The most honored among them are the [[Windscribes]] — those who can hear prophecy in static and story in the roar of thunder.

Their city is led by [[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer]], a figure not crowned by blood, but **chosen by resonance** — the one who best interprets the voice of [[Tempus]] and guides the chorus of the storm.

## Geography and Structure  
Unlike most dwarven cities, [[Thundrakar]] is built both **downward and upward**, spiraling around the [[Stormspire]] in layers of mine and citadel. The veins of [[Storm Quartz]] and [[Skyshatter Ore]] flow from the peak like lightning frozen in stone, pulsing with energy drawn from the bound essence of [[Tempus]].

The city’s core is anchored into the cliffs below the Spire, but its bridges and towers stretch outward into the sky — lightning-kissed spires and storm-singing chimes strung across the void.

## The Great Forge  
At the heart of Thundrakar lies the [[Great Forge of Ormr]], once the lair of the ancient bronze dragon [[Ormr]], whose body is said to have shaped the chamber’s vaulted maw. The forge is open to the sky, and **lightning is drawn directly into the anvils** through runes carved into the bones of the mountain.

This is the sacred heart of [[Stormforging]], the art of binding steel and storm.

## Elemental Seal  
Atop the [[Stormspire]], hidden within the endless maelstrom, lies the bound fragment of [[Tempus]] — the elemental god of storm and sky. It cannot be touched, only endured. [[Muradin]] sealed it there during [[the First Age]], shaping the mountain itself into a divine pylon.

The storm is not silenced — it is **channeled**.  
Its veins run downward through the mountain, forming conduits of [[Storm Quartz]] and [[Skyshatter Ore]]. These carry the storm’s memory into [[Thundrakar]] below.

[[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer]] oversees the rituals that maintain this resonance. Through chants, tuning, and lightning rites, they ensure the madness of the storm remains a message, not a scream.

> “The sky remembers what the world forgets. And we remember the sky.”
