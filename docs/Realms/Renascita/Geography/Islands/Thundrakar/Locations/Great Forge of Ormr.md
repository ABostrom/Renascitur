## Overview  
The [[Great Forge of Ormr]] is the sacred heart of [[Thundrakar]], the [[soul]]-ember of the [[Stormbound]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and the only known place in the world where **true [[Stormforging]]** can occur.

It is carved deep into the upper roots of the [[Stormspire]], and was once the lair of the ancient bronze dragon [[Ormr]] — a being of storm-breath and skyborn wisdom.

## The Dragon’s Legacy  
[[Ormr]] was not slain. He vanished.

Legends say he carved this hollow with his claws and wings, shaping a chamber that breathed the sky into stone. When [[Muradin]] walked the elemental planes, he met Ormr and was shown the power of resonance — the voice of the storm.

When the dragon vanished, the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of Thundrakar turned his lair into a forge. His bones were never found, but the anvil rests where his heart once beat.

> “It is said the lightning that strikes the forge is not from the sky — but from Ormr’s [[soul]].”

## Architecture  
The Forge is open to the sky through a wide, rune-etched chasm. **Lightning strikes directly into the forge’s heart**, guided by engraved pylons and resonant tuning towers. The walls shimmer faintly with static energy, and the stone itself hums with stormsong.

The anvil — *Ormr's Rest* — is made from fused [[Skyshatter Ore]] and polished with molten bronze. Lightning does not scar it. It remembers.

## Ritual Use  
Only master smiths and [[Windscribes]] are permitted to perform the [[Stormforging]] rites here. All tools must be tuned to storm resonance. Silence is mandatory during the rite, broken only by the thunder outside — and the hammer’s echo.

## Myth and Mystery  
Some say [[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer]] meditates here during moonless nights, speaking aloud into the void. Others believe the Forge is still alive — that Ormr’s spirit lingers, waiting for the day the storm calls him back.

> “The forge does not wait for you. It waits for the storm. Be worthy of its voice.”
