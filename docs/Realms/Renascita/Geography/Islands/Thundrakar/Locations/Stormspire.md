## Overview  
The [[Stormspire]] is the tallest mountain in the known world — a jagged, sky-piercing peak crowned by an **eternal storm**. It is the spiritual and elemental axis of the [[Stormbound]] dwarves, and the place where [[Muradin]] sealed the fragment of the storm god [[Tempus]] during [[the First Age]].

The storm above has not ceased since the sealing. It never sleeps, never stills. The spire is not just a mountain — it is a **living pylon**, a conduit for divine rage, memory, and skyfire.

## Elemental Seal  
At the summit of the [[Stormspire]] lies the bound fragment of [[Tempus]], god of thunder and sky. It cannot be approached by mortal hands — the storm would tear them apart. Only [[Muradin]] reached the peak, carving runes of memory and silence into the heart of the sky itself.

Rather than contain the storm, [[Muradin]] taught the dwarves to **resonate** with it. The [[Stormbound]] built no fortress atop the spire. Instead, they constructed **pylons**, **conductors**, and **harmonic towers**, tuning the storm's madness into memory.

> “It is not a prison. It is a song. One that must be remembered.”

## Geology and Power  
Veins of [[Storm Quartz]] and [[Skyshatter Ore]] twist down from the peak like frozen lightning, embedded deep in the mountain. These natural channels **carry the storm’s power downward**, into the [[Great Forge of Ormr]] and the heart of [[Thundrakar]] below.

When lightning strikes the peak — and it always does — it does not vanish. It echoes.

## Religious and Cultural Role  
The [[Stormspire]] is revered, feared, and studied. The [[Windscribes]] travel its lower slopes to listen to its resonance. The [[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer|High Conductor]] alone interprets its shifts in tone and fury.

It is said that should the pylons ever fall out of tune, the storm will remember what it once was — and awaken.

## Pilgrimage  
A few dwarves, overcome with purpose or madness, have tried to scale the Stormspire’s peak. None have returned.

> “To walk the Stormspire is to touch the mind of a god. And the mind of a god is not meant for dwarves to bear.”
