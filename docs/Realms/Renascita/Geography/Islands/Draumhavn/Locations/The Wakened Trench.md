## Overview

To the south of [[Draumhavn]], beyond the edge of the last charted reefs, lies a yawning abyss known only as **The Wakened Trench**. A fault in the world’s crust, it plunges into unknowable darkness—a place where even light forgets to return. It is said that when the trench first opened during the [[end of the First Age]], the tides themselves recoiled, and the water grew still with dread.

  
The [[Tidebound]] of Draumhavn do not speak of the trench lightly. Its existence predates their city, yet it is the reason they built their stronghold where they did. Every rune-seal, every tide-bound watchtower, and every salt-washed warship exists to ensure nothing ever rises from that abyss.

## The [[Leviathan]] Fragment

Buried within the Wakened Trench lies a **corrupted fragment of [[Leviathan]]**, the Great Elemental of the Sea. During the final days of [[the First Age]], [[Muradin]] carved this piece of [[Leviathan]]’s essence away after it was tainted by [[Ishna]]. The fragment—referred to in ancient dwarven runes as **Ul'Morrak**, or *the Maw That Hungers*—was bound by the First Seal of the Deep and cast into the trench.

- It cannot die. To destroy a world elemental is to unmake the world itself.
- It dreams of flood and famine. Its presence churns the tides with unrest.
- Strange storms and disappearances plague vessels that stray too near.

## Vigil and Tradition

The [[Draumhavn]] maintain an unbroken watch over the Wakened Trench. Generations of sea-wardens, deep readers, and salt-priests have kept the ancient rites alive, repeating the seals etched by [[Muradin]] himself.

- The **Saltwatch** sail its perimeter weekly, reciting verses from the [[The Codex of Iron]].
- Every ship launched from Draumhavn carries a token engraved with the [[Leviathan]] Bindrune.
- [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] born during full moons are taken to the edge of the trench for naming rites, binding them to the sea.

## Beliefs

The trench is not just a prison—it is a wound. The [[The Salt-Blessed|Tidebound]] believe it bleeds into the sea, poisoning the current with [[Leviathan]]’s rage. They do not seek to purify or cleanse it. They seek only to **endure**—to stand as a bulwark between the deep and the world above.
