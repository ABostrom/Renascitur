## Overview

Draumhavn is a dwarven island-state nestled in a perilous cluster of volcanic isles between the continents of [[Pyrosia]] and [[Qethusiyya]]. It stands as a fortress-port, a neutral bastion of trade between empires too proud or too bitter to speak directly. The sea around it is treacherous, haunted by abyssal horrors and cursed shoals, making Draumhavn both gateway and gatekeeper.

Its lifeline lies beneath the earth: the **Deep Road**, a vast subterranean rail and tunnel network connecting it to the mainland dwarven cities—**Uftine**, **Mithral Hall**, **[[Magnus]]' Rest**—and, more recently, the [[Ferrun]] stronghold of **Thelassia**. But no Deep Road runs south. There lies only the **Wakened Trench**, a chasm of unspeakable depth and hungering darkness.

## The [[Tidebound]]

The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of Draumhavn are known as the **[[Tidebound]]**. They are not mountain-folk but sea-dwellers, their lives shaped by storm and salt. Rather than religion, they follow a **Creed**—a philosophy of survival, discipline, and bond.

They revere the elemental forces of the sea without worshipping them, naming them:

- He Who Hungers ([[Leviathan]]): hunger, darkness, pressure
- She Who Wakes ([[Tempus]]): fury, rebirth, awakening

> _“We do not pray. We endure.”_ —[[Tidebound]] Saying

## Government: Naval Hierarchy
Draumhavn is ruled like a fleet, not a kingdom.

### High Tide Admiral: [[Dagrin Thorne]]

- Commands the city from the harbored warship _[[Leviathan]]’s Mercy_
- Enforces the **Code of Salt**, etched in a coral slab in the harbor square

Beneath him:
- **Stormcaptains** – Clan leaders and district commanders
- **Wavespeakers** – Oceanic strategists and tide-readers
- **Chainmasters** – Dockmasters and engineers
## Society & Industry

### Shipwright Clans
Draumhavn’s three great clans form the bedrock of its maritime power:
- [[Clan Blackwake]] – Leviathan-hunters, brute warships
- [[Clan Brinevein]] – Merchants and salvagers, sleek and swift
- [[Clan Deepforge]] – Submersibles and mechanized hulls

Each clan forges ships in its own style, with vessels detailed on their respective pages.
### Tideforging
Draumhavn’s unique craft, salt-tempered and rune-bound:

- Forging timed to the tides
- Metal quenched in brine, not water
- Runes sung into steel
See: [[Tideforging]]

### Salt-Blessed
Some [[The Salt-Blessed|Tidebound]] return from the deep changed:

- Gills, glowing veins, barnacle growths
- Deepwater vision, storm-sense, abyssal influence
- Feared and honoured; many serve in the silent order known as the [[Abysswatch]]
See: [[The Salt-Blessed]]

## Locations of Note
- [[Salt Cradle]] – The underground harbor and drydock heart of the city
- [[Stormgates]] – Outer sea-wall, studded with ballistae and elemental coils
- [[The Wakened Trench]] – Abyssal rift to the south, source of horrors

## The Deep Road
A secret, rune-reinforced tunnel system that connects Draumhavn to:
- [[Uftine Human]]
- [[Thundrakar]]
- [[Magnus’ Rest]]
- [[Thelassia]]

No tunnel runs south. The earth there falls away into the void.
