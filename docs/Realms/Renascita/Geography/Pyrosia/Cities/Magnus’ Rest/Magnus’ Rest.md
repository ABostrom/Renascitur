## Overview

[[Magnus’ Rest]] was the city founded by the god-forged hero [[Magnus]] shortly after the [[Psychic Schism]]. In the chaos that followed, he gathered a band of [[Dwarf|dwarves]], humans, and other refugees and led them into the volcanic mountains of southern [[Pyrosia]].

There, beside a smouldering caldera of [[Mt. Earthspur]], [[Magnus]] and his [[Forge Clerics]] defended the entrance to the nascent city for **a thousand nights**, waging endless battle against the horrors of the night. When at last the final stones were laid and the forges lit, the gates were sealed—not in retreat, but in preparation.

Magnus’ Rest became a **beacon of radiant fire**, an **enclave for all who fled the darkness**, in the days before the rise of the [[Firebrand Empire]] or the coming of the [[Unimus|Lightbringer]].

## Cultural Themes – The [[Flamebound]] [[Dwarf|Dwarves]]

The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of Magnus’ Rest are known as the **[[Flamebound]]**, and they live by the creed of **rebirth through fire**. Fire is more than a tool—it is a crucible of the [[soul]]. Through radiant heat, they believe that all things are tested, all weakness burned away.

They revere [[Magnus]] not only as a divine protector but as the living embodiment of radiant defiance. His doctrine, passed down through the [[Magnesium Devouts]], teaches that in the face of overwhelming night, the only righteous answer is to burn brighter.

The [[Flamebound]] value:
- **Sacrifice through hardship**
- **Perseverance under pressure**
- **Creation as a sacred act**

To forge is to pray. To endure is to worship.

## Geography & Structure

Magnus’ Rest is carved into the inner walls of a **volcanic caldera**, its tiers rising in concentric rings of black basalt and radiant stone. Lava channels flow throughout the city, directed by rune-forged sluices and reinforced with wards of light.

The skyline is dominated by [[The Ember Crown]]—a towering vent of [[Radiant Obsidian]] and [[Sun Topaz]], crowned with golden light and sacred flame. It houses the [[Eternal Flame]], the bound essence of [[Phenos]], and is considered the holiest place in the city.

The city is structured in three levels:

1. **The [[Ashward Gates]]** – The outer defensive ring, manned by the ever-vigilant [[Scorchguard]].  
2. **The [[Ember Veins]]** – The heart of industry, housing smithies, rune forges, and lava-craftsmen.  
3. **The [[Inner Crucible]]** – The spiritual and political centre, home to the [[Magnesium Devouts]], the Pyrethane, and sacred relics of [[Magnus]].

## Leadership

Magnus’ Rest is ruled by the **[[Volgrin Flameward|High Pyrethane]]**, a title meaning “Keeper of the Living Flame.” The Pyrethane serves as both high priest and military commander, guiding the city with fierce devotion and pragmatic resolve.

[[Volgrin Flameward|High Pyrethane Volgrin Flameward]] is the current ruler , a battle-scarred veteran and devout follower of [[Magnus]] who once wielded an Everburn greatsword during the city’s founding wars.

## Factions & Institutions

- **[[Magnesium Devouts]]** – Religious order of [[Magnus]], stewards of the [[Eternal Flame]]. Includes the [[Watch of the Dying Flame]].  
- **[[Scorchguard]]** – Elite defenders clad in radiant plate, trained to fight [[aberrations]] in confined spaces.

## The [[Eternal Flame]]

At the heart of Magnus’ Rest burns the [[Eternal Flame]]—a living fire unlike any other. Its light never dims. Its heat never fades. It is the bound essence of [[Phenos]], the Great Elemental of Flame and Renewal, sealed beneath the caldera in the waning days of [[the First Age]].

It was [[Muradin]], god of craft and sacrifice, who bound [[Phenos]]—not out of fear or hatred, but out of **love and foresight**. [[Muradin]] saw what had become of the other Elemental Kin—[[Zaratan]], [[Tempus]], and [[Leviathan]]—each falling prey to the creeping entropy of [[Ishna]]. Their primal forms twisted into monstrous echoes of themselves.

[[Muradin]] could not allow the same fate to befall [[Phenos]].

So, in an act of divine mercy, he **bound [[Phenos]]’ essence in radiant runes**, forging a sanctuary deep in the earth where the flame could burn eternally—untouched by corruption, watched over by those who still remembered what it meant to kindle hope.

Millennia later, in the chaos following the [[Psychic Schism]], it was the dying will of [[Muradin]] that guided [[Magnus]] to that place. There, Magnus raised a city atop the seal, vowing to guard the flame until the world was ready for its light once more.

The Eternal Flame:
- Burns with **divine radiance**, purifying [[aberrations]] and shielding the city from corruption  
- **Empowers the [[Everburn Forges]]**, allowing the [[Flamebound]] to craft weapons of [[Radiant Obsidian]] and [[Sun Topaz]]  
- Serves as a **spiritual anchor** for the [[Magnesium Devouts]], who tend its heart and preserve its song

## Radiant Forging – Sacred Craft of the [[Flamebound]]

The [[Flamebound]] are masters of **Radiant Forging**, a sacred and arduous discipline that merges divine heat, volcanic material, and dwarven craftsmanship.

All true Radiant Forging is performed within the [[Everburn Forges]], which are powered directly by the [[Eternal Flame]]. The process requires not only metallurgical skill but spiritual worthiness—flame, in [[Flamebound]] belief, reveals the truth of all things.

Radiant-forged weapons and armor:

- Glow with inner fire, especially in the presence of [[aberrations]] or corrupted beings  
- Never rust or cool fully; they carry the warmth of the Eternal Flame itself  
- Are often etched with runes of protection, memory, or purification  
- Can only be completed under the guidance of the [[Magnesium Devouts]]

Some relics of the First Flame, like the [[Sunforged Anvil]] and the sacred **Everburn Blades**, are considered holy objects, believed to carry echoes of [[Muradin]] and [[Magnus]]’ divine intent.

## Hidden Legacy – [[Solaran]] Stone and the Buried Gate

Long before the founding of Magnus’ Rest—before even the rise of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]]—this mountain was a site of **intense [[Solaran]] activity**.

Drawn by the rich veins of [[Radiant Obsidian]] and [[Sun Topaz]], [[Solaran]] researchers and architects carved deep into the volcanic rock, shaping vaults and cathedrals of fire-channeling crystal. Their purpose is lost to time, but some speculate they sought to **harvest and weaponize the primal flame** they discovered sealed beneath the earth—perhaps even [[Phenos]] himself.

Over millennia, their works collapsed, melted, and became twisted by time and tectonic shifts. Yet **some remnants remain**.

Among the deepest chambers of Magnus’ Rest—beyond the [[Ember Veins]] and sealed by forgotten sigils—lie fragments of [[Solaran]] stonework, half-melded into basalt, the light of the topaz long extinguished. The walls whisper, the metal sings, and the old glyphs pulse faintly when the [[Eternal Flame]] flares.

Most [[Dwarf|dwarves]] dismiss it as residual magic or old forge echoes.

But the [[Magnesium Devouts]] know better.

There are rumours of a **sealed [[Ab Solara]]** deep within these ruins—an ancient [[Solaran]] gateway that, if reawakened, could lead to lost archives, forgotten worlds, or perhaps **into the flame itself**.

Few seek the hidden gate. Fewer return. The old [[Solaran]] ghosts do not sleep quietly.
