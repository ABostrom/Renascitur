## Description
A reclaimed fortress-city forged from an ancient [[orc]] citadel. Built atop layers of siege and slaughter, it now stands defiant on the Empireâ€™s corrupted edge. Deep tunnels and hidden bastions beneath the city hint at its orcish past, with remnants of the [[Night War]] etched into its walls.
