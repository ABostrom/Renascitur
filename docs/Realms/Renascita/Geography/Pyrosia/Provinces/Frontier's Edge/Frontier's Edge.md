## Overview
A war-torn and reclaimed expanse once ruled by [[Orc|orcs]] and aberrant creatures. Now it stands as the Empireâ€™s final shield wall, fiercely protected by border clans and militant orders.

## Major Cities
- [[Ashgatar]]

## Notes
Seen as a punishment posting by some, a sacred duty by others. Imperators here are often hardened veterans or ascendant generals.
