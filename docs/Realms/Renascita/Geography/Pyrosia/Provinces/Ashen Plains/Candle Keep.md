Candle Keep was a famous library of great renown the world over. Before the [[Psychic Schism]] it contained tomes that could change the very nature of the world. Since the [[Psychic Schism|schism]] the keep has fallen into disrepair, and a small number of scholars have managed to keep the library safeguarded. Though knowledge of its location, and the tomes contained within, are forbidden within the [[Firebrand Empire]] there are some that would seek the lore for their own purposes.
