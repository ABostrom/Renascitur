This tavern is a roadside tavern along the [[Vialux]] between [[Lionâ€™s Rest]] and [[Lux Oescus]].

The tavern is owned by a [[Human]] woman named: [[Breona]]. She is a strong tempered woman, who will take no nonsense.

  

The tavern is not exclusively for citizens of the empire. But non-citizens by extortionate rates, and are required to sit in a segregated area. Bar fights naturally result from the animosity between citizens and foreigners, and the shunned.
