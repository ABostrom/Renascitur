**Pyrosia** is a vast and diverse land of elemental tension, tectonic fire, and sprawling nations. Bordered by volcanic coastlines and inland mountain arcs, the continent hosts an enormous range of biomes — from the charred [[Ashgatar]] highlands to the verdant woodlands near [[Raining Bay]].

The region is shared by an array of peoples, from the imperial courts of the [[Imperial Human]] to the fire-worshipping [[Flamebound Dwarves]] of [[Magnus' Rest]], and the coastal strongholds of the [[Leonin]] at [[Lion's Rest]].

The [[Ashen Range]] and [[Veilsmoke Ridge]] dominate the center of the continent, forming natural borders and spiritual frontiers. Rivers like the [[Redwash River]] flow southward from the molten peaks, bringing warmth and danger to the lowlands.
