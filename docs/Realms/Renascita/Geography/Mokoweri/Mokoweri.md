**Mokoweri** is a lush and vibrant continent of tangled life — a primeval realm where rivers run like veins and trees stretch toward the sun in layers of living canopy. It is the home of the [[Mokuun]], the [[Mokoweri Human]], and the bioengineered [[Saurian]], all united in their reverence for the sacred world tree [[Irasandra]].

The vast [[Zyran River]] winds through the [[Riverlands]] and past cities like [[Aeloria]] and [[Port Zyranzaru]], fed by thousands of hidden tributaries such as the [[Tir'Zal Tributary]] and [[Coatl's Vein]]. Towering ridges like the [[Obsidian Spine]] loom above the forest, hiding ancient [[Solaran]] ruins and pulse-reactive flora.

To outsiders, Mokoweri is a realm of mystery and danger — to its people, it is a living soul.
