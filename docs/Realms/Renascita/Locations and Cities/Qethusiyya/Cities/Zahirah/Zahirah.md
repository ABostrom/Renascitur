Zahirah is the thriving heart of commerce in the [[Vasir]], nestled among fertile deltas and intersecting glyphroads. Known for its sprawling bazaar, floating canal markets, and colorful canvas awnings enchanted with protective runes, it is a melting pot of culture, trade, and low-tier enchantment.

The city is governed loosely by a council of merchant guilds, with magical regulation enforced only lightly. While not openly defiant, Zahirah is viewed with suspicion by the Magocracy in [[Eltabarr]] for its tolerance of glyph innovation and rumour of Brimmed Cap artifacts passing through its underground markets.
