# [[The Hollowed Warrens]]

The **Hollowed Warrens** are the sacred heart of the [[Weavers of Agony]], a sprawling network of silk-veiled cathedrals, torture halls, and bio-organic tunnels nestled deep within [[The World Beneath]]. It is here that [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]] is said to whisper most clearly, her will echoing through vibrating strands of silk woven into the living stone.

Once an abandoned dwarven mining colony, the Warrens were claimed and reshaped by Varkhaal the Broken-Jawed following his descent into the dark. Under his leadership, the cult transformed the ruin into a grotesque sanctum of ritual suffering and metaphysical insight.

## Notable Features

- **The Loomheart**: A pulsating organic structure said to be woven from the skin and nerves of thousands. It functions as both altar and throne for Arachnie's seers.
- **The Silken Choir**: A vast chamber where victims are suspended in living webs, forced into eternal lamentation that forms the sacred hymns of the cult.
- **The Spiral Vein**: A descending tunnel, slick with ichor, believed to reach the deepest echo of Arachnie’s domain. Few return from its depths.

## Role in the Cult

The Warrens serve as:

- **A training ground** for high-ranking cultists.
- **A ritual hub** for blood-sacrifices and divine communion.
- **A pilgrimage site** for those seeking ascension through pain.

All threads, literal and prophetic, converge in the Hollowed Warrens.
