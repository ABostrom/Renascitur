 [[Yōkuro no Ki]] / [[Yunara]]  
## The Kyojin World Tree – The Tree of Spirit  

### [[First Age]] Name: [[Yōkuro no Ki]] (*The Veilroot Tree*)  
### [[Third Age]] Name: [[Yunara]] (*The Verdant Soul*)  

### Overview  
[[Yōkuro no Ki]], the **Veilroot Tree**, was a sacred site of the [[Kyojin]], believed to be a **gateway to the Umbra Terra**. It stood on the **northern border of Pyrosia**, where the land shifted between **light and shadow**. Its **ethereal blossoms** pulsed with the energy of the **soul cycle**, and shamans believed its **roots anchored spirits before rebirth**.

By the Third Age, the tree was lost to time, and the land surrounding it became a cursed wasteland. Now known only in myth as [[Yunara]], the **Verdant Soul**, it is said that the tree still exists somewhere in the twilight realm, its branches touching both **life and death**.

### Characteristics

- **Bark:** Dark violet, pulsing with spectral light.  
- **Roots:** Stretch across the **Veil**, anchoring the material and spiritual planes.  
- **Location:** Lost, but once stood on the **borderlands of the Firebrand Empire** in northern [[Pyrosia]].  

### Legacy
