# [[Weavers of Agony]]

The **Weavers of Agony** are a fanatical hobgoblin cult devoted to [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]. Once a disciplined legion of war-hardened hobgoblins, they have been twisted—physically and spiritually—by [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]'s divine torment. Their ideology centers on the belief that **pain is sacred**, **scars are scripture**, and **suffering is the path to ascension**.

## Origins

The cult was founded by [[Varkhaal Bloodlash]], a hobgoblin general who vanished during a campaign into [[The World Beneath]]. He returned months later, changed and bearing a vision from [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]. His face had been torn open and reshaped—his jaw shattered and left permanently broken, a wound he refused to let heal. He claimed the pain kept her voice close. From that moment, he abandoned his old name and became known as **Varkhaal the Broken-Jawed**. He preached that through suffering and transformation, his legion would become her chosen children. From this revelation, the **Weavers of Agony** were born.

## Beliefs

- **Pain is sacred**: Enduring it brings spiritual strength.
- **Scars are scripture**: Each is a verse in [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]'s grand design.
- **The World is a Web**: All fates are interconnected.
- **The Flesh is a Loom**: Through agony, one's body is reshaped for divine purpose.

## Structure

- **The [[Varkhaal Bloodlash|First Fang]]**: Varkhaal the Broken-Jawed – prophet-general of the cult.
- **Silkbound Seers**: Pain-prophets who channel [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]’s will.
- **Weaver-Knights**: Elite warriors with severed pain centers and ritual scars.
- **Venomtouched**: Horrifically mutated cult champions.
- **Silkspawn**: Fused hobgoblin-spider monstrosities.
- **Cocooned Choirs**: Captive thralls used in ongoing ritual lamentations.

## Sacred Sites

- **[[The Hollowed Warrens]]**: The cult's subterranean cathedral, located deep within [[The World Beneath]], wrapped in living silk and saturated with psychic torment.
    
- **The Loom-Spires**: Mobile siege temples used in surface conquests, each one trailing webs and bearing the sigils of [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]].
    
- **The Pit of Screams**: A ritual site deep in [[The World Beneath]] where echoes of agony are divined for prophecy.
    

## Rituals & Symbols

- **The Ritual of Unthreading**: Initiation by severing and reconnection of nerves through spider venom and guided torture beneath the silk-veiled sanctums of [[The World Beneath]].
    
- **The Webbrand**: A glowing scar of [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]'s sigil—two triangles and a circle—burned into the chest.
    
- **The Silken Tongue**: Cultists stitch their mouths and speak only in ritual whispers laced with the Matriarch's teachings.
    

## Threat & Spread

While many hobgoblin clans denounce the Weavers as heretics, their influence is growing. Warbands fractured by trauma or defeat often fall into their web. Rumors suggest [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]'s whispers now reach **the surface**, infecting even non-goblinoid minds. More troubling are sightings of Weavers migrating through fissures and tunnels that lead from [[The World Beneath]] to the realms above.

## Adventure Hooks

- **[[Ferrun]] Engineers Abducted**: The cult is stealing workers for a massive living altar under [[Salacia]], their ritual chamber linked directly to [[The World Beneath]].
    
- **Silkborne Plague**: An afflicted village suffers psychic pain and scarification, symptoms believed to be a curse from [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]].
    
- **The Return of Varkhaal**: Now a horror of silk and claw, he marches toward a dwarven city to begin the First Weaving—a grand act of worship that will open a gate to [[The World Beneath]].
