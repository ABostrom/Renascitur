The mages of a high sorcery are a pseudo-secret organisation that spans across the various civilisations of the world. With no particular allegiances, although most members choose to reside openly in the [[Thraysian Magocracy]]. This is more out of pragmatism than choice. The open hostility to mages within the [[Firebrand Empire]] makes it very difficult for them to operate openly and safely.
