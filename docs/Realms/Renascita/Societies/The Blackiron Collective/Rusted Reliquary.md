The obsidian tablet, standing nearly ten feet tall and polished to a mirror-like finish, is an artifact of immense historical and cultural significance to the [[Ferrun]] of Thelassia. Its surface is inscribed with glowing [[Solaran]] runes and intricate carvings, illuminated faintly by the energy that flows through the relic. The tablet tells a fragmented story of the [[Solaran|Solarans]]’ rise and fall, their descent into the world beneath, and the emergence of the Metal Elves.


## The [[Solaran|Solarans]]’ Ascendancy
- **Text**: Written in elegant [[Solaran]] script, this section speaks of the [[Solaran|Solarans]]’ mastery over the trifecta of **Arcane**, **Science**, and **Nature**. It extols their creation of wonders, including the Endless Sun, their spacefaring vessels, and their harmonious society.
- **Carvings**: Depictions of celestial cities suspended in starlight, massive crystalline structures harnessing the energy of the sun, and [[Solaran|Solarans]] clad in flowing robes working in unity.

## [[The Fall of the Endless Sun]]
- **Text**: This panel describes the corruption of the Endless Sun by **[[Ishna]]**, [[Ishna|the God Unborn]], and the devastating [[psychic schism]] that shattered their civilization. The words describe the [[Solaran|Solarans]]’ desperate attempts to flee their dying world, their sacrifices, and their ultimate descent into the darkness below.
- **Carvings**: The Endless Sun, darkened and cracked, radiates chaotic energy. Beneath it, [[Solaran|Solarans]] flee into the void, their figures transformed by grief and desperation. Tendrils of aberrant corruption snake through the image.

## The Rise of the [[Ferrun]]
- **Text**: The third panel tells of the [[Solaran|Solarans]] who embraced the pillar of **Science** and found refuge in the depths of the world. It speaks of their ingenuity, their ability to adapt, and their transformation into the [[Ferrun]]. It celebrates their resilience, though it hints at the price they paid in abandoning their connection to the Arcane and Nature.
- **Carvings**: Depictions of engineers building the [[Coalforge Engine]], crafting mechanical limbs, and reforging their society in the glow of molten metal. Figures are adorned with tools and prosthetics, standing amidst a sea of gears and steam.

## A Warning and a Hope
- **Text**: The final panel issues a solemn warning about the consequences of hubris and the dangers of aberrant corruption. It speaks cryptically of the need to balance the pillars of [[Solaran]] culture to avoid repeating the past. It also calls for vigilance, innovation, and unity to defend against the darkness.
- **Carvings**: A split image of a thriving industrial city on one side and a crumbling, corrupted ruin on the other. In the center, a radiant crystal shines faintly, hinting at the enduring power of [[Solaran]] legacy.
