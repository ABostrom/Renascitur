The [[Ferrun]], descendants of the **[[Solaran|Solarans]]** who turned to science and craftsmanship, have spent centuries studying the collapse of the **[[Machinery of Death]]**. They realized early on that the souls of their people were **not moving on**, lingering in the world before fading into oblivion. Rather than allow their loved ones to **vanish from existence**, they devised a way to **bind and store their souls** using an advanced version of [[Solaran]] [[soul]] magic.

- The **Great Vault** of the [[Ferrun]] is an immense underground chamber lined with crystalline conduits and obsidian constructs, each one housing the essence of a [[Ferrun]] [[soul]]. These souls are not simply storedâ€”they retain a level of **consciousness**, able to **speak** through special interfaces, offering guidance to their descendants and engineers.
- This practice was born out of **desperation**, but over time, the [[Ferrun]] have come to see it as a **sacred duty**. They believe that the souls of their ancestors are **meant to remain**, acting as keepers of knowledge until a true solution to the failing cycle of life and death can be found.
