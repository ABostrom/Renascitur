The **Uftine Express** is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the dwarven people, an underground railway network that spans multiple continents, linking some of the most powerful and industrious cities of the world. Built with masterful dwarven engineering and rune-infused steel, the Express allows for rapid travel and trade beneath the surface, far from the dangers of the overworld.

#### **Major Connections**

The Uftine Express connects several key locations across the known world:

- [[Thundrakar]] – A legendary dwarven stronghold located far in the northeast, known for its vast mithral deposits and formidable warriors.
- [[Uftine Humans]] – The namesake of the Express, this city is a major dwarven settlement in the northwest of **Arcturia**, renowned for its metallurgical advancements and deep mining operations.
- [[Magnus’ Rest]] – Located on the continent of **Pyrosia**, [[Magnus’ Rest]] is a city of great historical significance, named after a fallen dwarven hero. It serves as a vital trading post and military stronghold.
- [[Draumhavn]] – A free city that serves as the underground hub of the Express, acting as a central terminal where the tunnels from all three dwarven holds converge. 
- [[Thelassia]] - Now, with the recent agreement between the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and the [[Ferrun]], the network is expanding to integrate [[Ferrun]] infrastructure.
