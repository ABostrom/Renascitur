## Title  
**High Conductor of Thundrakar**  
Interpreter of the Storm. Voice of the Sky.

## Overview  
[[Aundril Voxhammer]] is the spiritual and political leader of the [[Stormbound]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Thundrakar]]. Chosen not by lineage, but by resonance, she holds her title as one who can listen — truly listen — to the will of [[Tempus]], the storm god whose fragment is bound atop the [[Stormspire]].

Her words shape rites, her tone aligns the pylons, and her presence calms even the most turbulent forgefire.

## Early Life  
Born during a storm that shattered one of Thundrakar’s highest pylons, Aundril’s birth was marked as a skyborn omen. Even as a child, she could sense shifts in pressure and hear thunder before it rolled. At the age of seven, she was taken in by the [[Windscribes]] for training.

She is said to have once calmed a rogue lightning wraith with a single harmonic chant.

## Role as High Conductor  
Aundril presides over the **Spire Choral**, the great resonance rite held when the sealed fragment of [[Tempus]] becomes unstable. Her voice, attuned to storm harmonics, guides the tuning of pylons across the mountain.

She wields *Voxtharn*, a ceremonial hammer tipped with crystalline [[Storm Quartz]], said to hum the names of the fallen when held aloft in the wind.

> “You cannot command the storm. But if you learn to listen, it may choose to answer.”

## Beliefs  
Aundril teaches that the storm does not rage without purpose — it remembers. Her mission is to **record the thunder’s memory**, and ensure it is not lost.

Some say she communes with the lightning atop the [[Stormspire]] during moonless nights. Others whisper that she has begun to hear names in the storm that have not yet lived.

## Legacy  
Though still in her prime, Aundril is already seen by many as the most attuned High Conductor in centuries. Some Windscribes believe she is preparing Thundrakar for a coming reckoning — one only she can hear.

> “When the thunder calls your name, do not answer in fear. Answer in harmony.”
