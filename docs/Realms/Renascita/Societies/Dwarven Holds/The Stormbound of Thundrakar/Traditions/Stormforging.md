## Overview  
[[Stormforging]] is the sacred art of the [[Stormbound]] dwarves of [[Thundrakar]], a form of elemental smithing unlike any other. Where other forges burn coal or channel flame, a stormforge draws power from **lightning itself**, shaping not just metal, but **memory and resonance**.

To stormforge is not to bend the storm to your will — it is to strike in time with it.

## Origins  
The art of [[Stormforging]] was born in the vaulted ruins that would become the [[Great Forge of Ormr]], once the lair of the ancient bronze dragon [[Ormr]]. The dragon’s breath once carved the stone — now lightning dances where he once slept.

[[Muradin]] himself is said to have struck the first runes into lightning-tempered steel here during his pilgrimage through the elemental planes.

## The Process  
The stormforge is a carefully tuned chamber open to the sky, built around lightning pylons and **resonance amplifiers** crafted from [[Storm Quartz]]. As the storm gathers above the [[Stormspire]], energy is drawn through runes and focused into the forge itself.

The smith must strike at the **precise moment of lightning’s arrival**, binding the energy to the metal mid-hammerfall. Mistiming a strike risks madness, ruin, or the blade screaming every name you’ve ever forgotten.

## Materials  
Only a few materials can survive true stormforging:

- [[Skyforged Steel]] — Forged from standard dwarven steel and trace [[Skyshatter Ore]], tempered with the essence of storm.
- [[Storm Quartz]] — Crystalline resonance stones used to amplify and tune forging chambers.
- [[Skyshatter Ore]] — Unstable ore that carries echoes of past storms and can rupture under pressure.

Each piece is **resonant**, often humming when held aloft, or whispering battle cries remembered by the forge itself.

## Ritual and Lore  
Stormforging is performed in ritual silence, broken only by the voice of the storm. Smiths wear tuning-helms etched with resonance glyphs to shield their minds. It is believed that each stormforged item remembers the song of the moment it was born.

The greatest forgemasters say that stormforging is not crafting — it is **transcription**.
