## Title: [[Icebound]] Thane of Uftine

Gromdir Stillhand is the ruling figure of [[Uftine Human]], known by his formal title as the **[[Icebound]] Thane** He is a dwarven elder of immense gravitas, bearing the mantle of silence, memory, and resilience passed down through generations of [[Icebound]] leadership. His skin is veined with frost, and his hands—unshaking, deliberate—move as though carved from the glacier itself.

## Character
Gromdir speaks rarely, but his words carry the weight of centuries. His leadership style reflects Uftine’s foundational principles: restraint, contemplation, and the eternal preservation of balance. He is not known for speeches, but for presence—his very stillness holds the city together.

- **Known for:** Resolving conflicts with a glance, reinforcing the [[The Pulsecore]] runes during the Black Frostquake, and crafting the Binding Hammer of Deep Ice.
- **Belief:** That silence is the strongest rune, and that frost preserves all truths.

## Role
As the [[Icebound]] Thane, Gromdir serves as both sovereign and spiritual anchor of the [[Icebound]]. He governs with the advice of the [[Fracturecast]], but his judgment is final. He alone walks the deepest halls of the [[The Pulsecore|Pulsecore]], where the corrupted progeny of [[Zaratan]] lies imprisoned.

## Legacy
Though aging, Gromdir’s legacy is already being etched into crystal tablets. His reign is marked by a return to ancestral precision, a renewed emphasis on [[Iceforging]] purity, and the quiet containment of growing tremors from the deep.
