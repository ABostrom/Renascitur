## Overview  
[[Iceforging]] is the signature smithing tradition of the [[Icebound|Icebound Dwarves]] of [[Uftine Human]], a slow and deliberate craft that uses **cold, pressure, and resonance** rather than flame. Where other [[Dwarf|dwarves]] strike with fire and fury, the [[Icebound]] whisper to the metal — teaching it to hold, endure, and remember.

It is not about bending metal — it is about teaching it to be **still**.

## Origins  
The art of Iceforging was born from necessity. With fire difficult to sustain in the glacial halls of [[Uftine Human]], early smiths began to experiment with **pressure-hardening**, **cold-tempering**, and rune-etched freezing chambers. Over centuries, this developed into a unique and sacred form of metalwork.

The presence of [[The Pulsecore]] — the sealed fragment of [[Zaratan]] — imbues the region with elemental stability and resonance, further influencing the shaping process.

## Process  
In Iceforging, heat is used only in the earliest phase to shape the raw ore. Once the base form is created, it is submerged in glacial brine, compressed with rune-weighted presses, and **left to rest within Stillstone vaults**, where the natural resonance of the stone sings to the metal.

Time is a key component. Some weapons take **decades** to cure.

Forging songs are whispered in rhythmic breath — never louder than the frost’s crack.

## Materials Used  
- [[Icevein Steel]] – Forged from iron and trace [[Stillstone Ore]], tempered through exposure to glacial silence and echo.
- [[Stillstone Ore]] – A heavy, resonant ore found deep within the frostbound caverns near [[The Pulsecore]].
- [[Frost Diamond]] – A rare, ice-veined crystal that stores sound and memory, often used to harmonize runes or imbue weapons with historic resonance.

## Properties of Iceforged Items  
- **Echo-Retentive**: Can record sounds, whispers, or even final words.
- **Unyielding**: Resistant to shattering and highly durable in extreme environments.
- **Runic Clarity**: Runes etched into Iceforged items maintain perfect symmetry and permanence, resisting wear.

## Cultural Importance  
To [[Icebound]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]], Iceforging is a sacred duty. Weapons are not made for war — they are made for **memory**, for **resistance**, and for **the long watch**. Many Iceforged relics are **interred with the dead**, whose souls are said to echo forever in the blades they carried.

Only the most patient and composed smiths are permitted to undertake the rite.
