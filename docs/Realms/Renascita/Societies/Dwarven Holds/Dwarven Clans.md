## Overview
Each dwarven city is descended from the ancient [[Grundthain]] and shaped by an elemental tradition tied unknowingly to a Great Elemental:

- **[[Tidebound]]** of [[Draumhavn]] – Linked to [[Leviathan]]
- **[[Icebound]]** of [[Uftine Human]] – Linked to [[Zaratan]]
- **[[Stormbound]]** of [[Thundrakar]]] – Linked to [[Tempus]]
- **[[Flamebound]]** of [[Magnus’ Rest]] – Linked to [[Phenos]]

Each dwarven city is also built atop a sealed corruption of that elemental, entombed by [[Muradin]].



## Defense & Vigilance
The reason for the [[Dwarf|dwarves]]' unyielding traditions, towering fortresses, and inward-focused cities can be traced back to the [[end of the First Age]]. When the Great Elementals—[[Leviathan]], [[Zaratan]], [[Tempus]], and [[Phenos]]—were partially corrupted by [[Ishna]]'s touch, they could not be destroyed without shattering the foundations of the world itself. [[Muradin]], father of runes, devised another solution: to carve the corrupted aspects from the living elementals and seal them like cancers beneath the earth, bound in stone and glyph.
