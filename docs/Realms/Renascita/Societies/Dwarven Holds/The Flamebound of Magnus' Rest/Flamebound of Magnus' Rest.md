## Cultural Themes – The [[Flamebound]] [[Dwarf|Dwarves]]

The [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of Magnus’ Rest are known as the **[[Flamebound]]**, and they live by the creed of **rebirth through fire**. Fire is more than a tool—it is a crucible of the [[soul]]. Through radiant heat, they believe that all things are tested, all weakness burned away.

They revere [[Magnus]] not only as a divine protector but as the living embodiment of radiant defiance. His doctrine, passed down through the [[Magnesium Devouts]], teaches that in the face of overwhelming night, the only righteous answer is to burn brighter.

The [[Flamebound]] value:
- **Sacrifice through hardship**
- **Perseverance under pressure**
- **Creation as a sacred act**

To forge is to pray. To endure is to worship.


## Radiant Forging – Sacred Craft of the [[Flamebound]]

The [[Flamebound]] are masters of **Radiant Forging**, a sacred and arduous discipline that merges divine heat, volcanic material, and dwarven craftsmanship.

All true Radiant Forging is performed within the [[Everburn Forges]], which are powered directly by the [[Eternal Flame]]. The process requires not only metallurgical skill but spiritual worthiness—flame, in [[Flamebound]] belief, reveals the truth of all things.

Radiant-forged weapons and armor:

- Glow with inner fire, especially in the presence of [[aberrations]] or corrupted beings  
- Never rust or cool fully; they carry the warmth of the Eternal Flame itself  
- Are often etched with runes of protection, memory, or purification  
- Can only be completed under the guidance of the [[Magnesium Devouts]]

Some relics of the First Flame, like the [[Sunforged Anvil]] and the sacred **Everburn Blades**, are considered holy objects, believed to carry echoes of [[Muradin]] and [[Magnus]]’ divine intent.
