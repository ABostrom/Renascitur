## Overview

The **Eternal Flame** is a divine, radiant fire that burns at the heart of [[Magnus’ Rest]], housed within the volcanic summit known as [[The Ember Crown]]. It is the bound essence of the [[Great Elemental]] [[Phenos]], sealed long ago by [[Muradin]] to protect the world from corruption and to preserve one untainted element of flame.

It serves as both the **spiritual heart** and the **arcane engine** of the city—a source of divine light, purifying heat, and sacred authority.

## Origins

In the twilight of the [[First Age]], as [[Ishna]]’s entropy began to corrupt the primal elements, [[Muradin]] foresaw that even the great elemental beings would be turned. To prevent this, he enacted a divine rite and **bound the essence of [[Phenos]]**—the Elemental of Flame and Renewal—into a sealed flame deep beneath the volcanic mountains of [[Pyrosia]].

There the flame remained hidden and protected, its power untouched by corruption.

After the [[Psychic Schism]], it was the **dying will of [[Muradin]]** that guided [[Magnus]] to the mountain. He built Magnus’ Rest atop the seal, vowing to protect the flame—and the world—from what might come if it were ever extinguished… or unbound.

## Purpose & Power

The Eternal Flame is not merely fire. It is **living radiance**—a fusion of divine will, elemental truth, and cosmic memory.

Its influence:

- **Purifies corruption**, particularly from [[aberrations]] and entities tied to [[Ishna]]  
- Acts as a **psychic ward**, shielding minds and spirits within the city  
- Powers the [[Everburn Forges]] and the act of [[Radiant Forging]]  
- Serves as the spiritual tether for the [[Magnesium Devouts]], whose rituals are centered around its flame

Some believe the flame can even **heal the [[soul]]**, though such miracles are rare and always come at a cost.

## Physical Manifestation

The Eternal Flame rises from a **chamber of obsidian and topaz**, ringed in ancient runes etched by [[Muradin]] himself. It is not a natural fire—it **burns without consuming**, glows with golden-white brilliance, and **sings softly in the forge-speech** of [[the First Age]] when the city is quiet.

When threatened, it flares violently, lashing out with waves of radiant heat that disintegrate corruption and call back the faithful.

---

## Guardianship

The flame is tended and protected by the [[Magnesium Devouts]], particularly by the secretive order known as the [[Watch of the Dying Flame]]. Only they know the **true scale of the seal**, and what may happen should it break.

Some whisper that the flame is **growing brighter**. Others fear it is **flickering**.

Either would be dangerous.

---

## Relationship to [[Phenos]]

The Eternal Flame is **[[Phenos]] in part**, but not whole.

[[Muradin]] did not destroy the elemental—he **bound a fragment** of his essence, preserving it in radiant purity. This act of mercy was both gift and curse: the flame cannot grow, but it also cannot be corrupted.

Some fear that **if the seal fails**, [[Phenos]] will awaken—but whether he returns as savior or inferno is unknown.

## Cultural Significance

To the people of Magnus’ Rest, the Eternal Flame is not just protection—it is **purpose**.

- It is the **divine legacy of [[Muradin]]**  
- The **spiritual compass of the Pyrethane**  
- The **source of Radiant Forging**, and thus the city’s survival  
- And the **light in the dark**, when all other fires fail

Every [[Flamebound]] child is brought to the Flame for naming. Every hero is cremated before it. Every oath of office is sworn in its glow.
