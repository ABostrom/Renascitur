## Overview

The **Magnesium Devouts** are the spiritual order of the [[Flamebound]] dwarves of [[Magnus’ Rest]]. Founded by [[Magnus]] and entrusted to [[Volgrin Flameward]], they are not simply priests—they are **guardians, artisans, and witnesses** to the Eternal Flame.

Their creed is not one of dogma, but of duty:  
 - *Preserve the Eternal Flame.*  
 - *Refine the soul through hardship.*  
 - *Temper creation with truth.*  

They oversee sacred rites, train Radiant Forgers, tend to the [[Everburn Forges]], and stand as the moral and mystical backbone of Flamebound society.

## Symbolism & Name

Their name honors **magnesium**, a silvery-white metal that burns with intense radiance and cannot be extinguished by water—**a symbol of unrelenting light and defiant purity**.

To the Devouts, magnesium is not just a material—it is a metaphor. Like their order, it burns brightest in darkness.

## The Watch of the Dying Flame

A secretive inner sect within the Devouts tasked with monitoring the **stability of the Eternal Flame**. They believe the flame is a seal as much as it is a gift, and they prepare for the day it may falter—or awaken something deeper.

They answer only to the [[Volgrin Flameward|High Pyrethane]].

---

## Beliefs

- **Fire reveals truth**: Anything false will burn away in its light  
- **Sacrifice is sanctity**: Creation is paid for in hardship  
- **Radiance defies entropy**: Flame is the promise that the dark does not win

They do not worship **Magnus** as a god, but honor him as a **flame-bearer**, a mortal who *became worthy of the flame*.
