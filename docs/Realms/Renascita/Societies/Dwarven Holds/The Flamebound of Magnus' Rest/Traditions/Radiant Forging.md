## Overview

**Radiant Forging** is the sacred forging tradition of the [[Flamebound]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Magnus’ Rest]]. Unlike other elemental forging arts, Radiant Forging is not merely a method of shaping metal—it is a **spiritual rite**, a means of purifying, binding, and preserving intention through fire.

Only those who have undergone the **Rite of Emberbinding**—a trial overseen by the [[Magnesium Devouts]]—may wield the Eternal Flame in the act of creation. These master smiths are known as **Radiant Forgers**.

## The Process

All true Radiant Forging is performed within the [[Everburn Forges]], divine forges fueled directly by the [[Eternal Flame]]—the bound essence of [[Phenos]], the Great Elemental of Flame and Renewal.

The process combines:

- **Volcanic materials** like [[Radiant Obsidian]] and [[Sun Topaz]]  
- **Sacred rune etching**, performed during moments of spiritual stillness  
- Exposure to **soulfire**, which reacts to intent and memory  
- The presence of a **Magnesium Devout**, who oversees the purity of the act

Each creation is meant to endure—not just physically, but spiritually.

## Properties of Radiant-Forged Items

- Radiant-forged blades **glow** in the presence of [[aberrations]] and **burn with radiant flame** when wielded by the worthy  
- Armor resists **psychic intrusion** and **entropy-based decay**  
- Tools crafted in this way often seem to **resonate with their wielder’s will**  
- Each piece carries a **soulmark**, a rune inscribed at the moment the forge flame flares in response to truth

## Known Relics of Radiant Forging

### [[Everburn Blades]]
Forged by [[Volgrin Flameward]] during the defense of the city. Said to burn brighter with each foe struck in defense of the innocent.

### [[Ashmantle]]
A cloak of radiant mail that can turn psychic fire and reflect [[soul]]-sapping energies. Only worn by the High Devout.

### [[The Sunforged Anvil]]
A relic from [[the First Age]]. The only known anvil to **ring in harmony** with the Eternal Flame. No Radiant Forger may begin their work without touching it in prayer.

## The Rite of Emberbinding

Only those who endure the **Rite of Emberbinding** may become Radiant Forgers. This rite involves:

- Meditating in the Crucible Hall for **seven nights**  
- Walking the **Path of Cinders** barefoot while carrying raw [[Radiant Obsidian]]  
- Casting their **own soulmark** in the flames of the [[Everburn Forges]]

Failure to complete the rite without faltering spiritually or physically results in permanent banishment from the forge halls.

## Cultural Significance

To the [[Flamebound]], Radiant Forging is not simply a craft—it is a **covenant**. Through fire, they commune with the will of [[Muradin]] and [[Magnus]], forging legacy from loss and light from ruin. In a world beset by shadows, a Radiant-forged blade is not just a weapon. It is a **promise**.
