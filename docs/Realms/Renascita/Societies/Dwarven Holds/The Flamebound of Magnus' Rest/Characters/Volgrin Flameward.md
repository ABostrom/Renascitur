## Overview

**Volgrin Flameward**, First [[Pyrethane]] of [[Magnus’ Rest]], was not born a leader, warrior, or prophet. He was a frightened young dwarf—barely into his second decade—when the [[Psychic Schism]] shattered his home and stole his family. He would have died in the dark, if not for a stranger wreathed in flame who pulled him from the rubble.

That stranger was [[Magnus]].

In the centuries since, Volgrin has become a **grizzled, enduring legend**—a master [[Radiant Forger]], living bulwark, and the only dwarf alive who remembers the founding of the city firsthand. He is **the [[soul]] of the Flamebound**, shaped not by birthright, but by fire, loss, and an unbreakable promise.

## Origins

Volgrin was born in the outer foothills of [[Pyrosia]], in a minor dwarven settlement erased entirely during the first wave of the [[Psychic Schism|Schism]]. When the [[aberrations]] struck, his home was consumed, his kin devoured or mind-broken.

He was found days later, trapped beneath scorched stone, his eyes burned raw from psychic light.

[[Magnus]] lifted him from the ruin.

He never left his side again.

## The Thousand Nights

Volgrin grew up with the [[Forge Clerics]] during the building of [[Magnus’ Rest]], learning to wield hammer and shield while the walls rose. Though still young, he fought during the **Thousand Nights of Flamegate**, defending the mountain pass from endless waves of aberrant horrors.

It was during this siege that he received his soulmark and forged the first [[Everburn Blade]], guided by the hand of [[Magnus]].

By the end of the siege, he was no longer a boy.  
He was **Volgrin Flameward**—named by [[Magnus]] himself, for the way he stood before the gates, refusing to fall.

## Rise as Pyrethane

After the gates were sealed, [[Magnus]] retreated into the [[Eternal Flame]], leaving behind a final command:  
> *“You are what I was. Guard what I leave.”*

Volgrin was anointed the first **[[Pyrethane]]**, Keeper of the Living Flame and leader of the city. He reluctantly accepted, believing himself unworthy—but as years became decades, and then centuries, Volgrin endured.

He forged new warriors. He refined [[Radiant Forging]]. He passed judgment with mercy, and fought with wrath. He did not ascend like [[Magnus]].  
He *remained*.

## Current Status

Volgrin still lives, now ancient beyond reckoning—but neither feeble nor faded. His beard is singed white, his eyes burn with soulfire, and his armor carries a thousand scars.

He is quiet, steady, and feared even among his own. Children believe he no longer sleeps—that he simply sits in meditation before the [[Eternal Flame]], waiting for the next threat to rise.
