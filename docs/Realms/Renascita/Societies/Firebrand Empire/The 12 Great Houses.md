# The Twelve Great Houses of the Firebrand Empire

The Firebrand Empire is ruled by a [[docs/Races/Kyojin/Leonin/Leonin|Leonin]] Emperor, but its strength and longevity depend on the governance of the Twelve Great Houses. These noble dynasties form the backbone of imperial society, each entrusted with a specific domain of influence and responsibility.

Together, the Houses make up the Imperial Council — a body that advises the Emperor and wields immense soft and hard power throughout the Empire. While their domains are clearly defined, the boundaries of influence often blur, leading to shifting alliances, rivalries, and cold wars within the council chambers.

## Structure and Domains

Each House is defined by a specific area of imperial responsibility, and is expected to manage that sphere at every level of society — from infrastructure to personnel to strategy.

- [[House Medani]] — Internal security and inquisition
- [[House Tharashk]] — External threat hunting and wilderness operations
- [[House Vadalis]] — Animal husbandry and cavalry logistics
- [[House Jorasco]] — Healing, medicine, and field surgery
- [[House Silverhand]] — Trade, hospitality, and economic policy
- [[House Cannith]] — Construction, engineering, weapons development
- [[House Orien]] — Transport, supply lines, and imperial logistics
- [[House Sivis]] — Bureaucracy, scribes, encoded communications
- [[House Deneith]] — Sentinels, law enforcement, and internal defense
- [[House Phiarlan]] — Espionage, assassination, and psychological operations
- [[House Lyrandar]] — Cosmology, weather control, and navigational magic
- [[House Kundarak]] — Arcane security and dwarven warding magic

## Political Axes

Though bound by duty to the Emperor, the Houses rarely operate in harmony. Ideological and functional blocs have emerged within the Council:

| House      | Stability Bloc | Hardliners & Watchers | Wild Front | Outliers & Hidden Powers |
| :--------- | :------------: | :-------------------: | :--------: | :----------------------: |
| Cannith    |       ✓        |                       |            |                          |
| Orien      |       ✓        |                       |            |                          |
| Silverhand |       ✓        |                       |            |                          |
| Sivis      |       ✓        |           ✓           |            |                          |
| Deneith    |       ✓        |           ✓           |            |                          |
| Medani     |       ✓        |           ✓           |            |                          |
| Jorasco    |                |                       |     ✓      |                          |
| Tharashk   |                |                       |     ✓      |                          |
| Vadalis    |                |                       |     ✓      |                          |
| Phiarlan   |                |                       |            |            ✓             |
| Lyrandar   |                |                       |            |            ✓             |
| Kundarak   |                |                       |            |            ✓             |

### The Stability Bloc

**Members**: [[House Cannith]], [[House Orien]], [[House Silverhand]], [[House Sivis]], [[House Deneith]], [[House Jorasco]]

This pragmatic faction focuses on the day-to-day operation of the Empire. Builders, traders, healers, and enforcers, these Houses form the administrative backbone of imperial control and expansion.

### The Hardliners and Watchers

**Members**: [[House Medani]], [[House Deneith]], [[House Sivis]]

This alliance favors increased surveillance, restricted arcane movement, and harsh punishments for insubordination or heresy. They believe internal decay is the greatest threat to the Empire.

### The Wild Front

**Members**: [[House Tharashk]], [[House Vadalis]], [[House Jorasco]]

These Houses hold sway in the frontier provinces and wilderness outposts. They are rugged, adaptable, and focused on dealing with threats from the outer edges of civilization.

### The Outliers and Hidden Powers

**Members**: [[House Phiarlan]], [[House Lyrandar]], [[House Kundarak]]

Often distrusted by other factions, these Houses specialize in secrecy, arcana, and long-range influence. While rarely aligned on policy, they share outsider status and mutual strategic value.

## Key Political Tensions

Some rivalries define the current political landscape of the Council:

- **[[House Medani]] vs [[House Phiarlan]]** — Open investigation vs covert manipulation
- **[[House Tharashk]] vs [[House Medani]]** — Clashing over jurisdiction and ideology
- **[[House Deneith]] vs [[House Phiarlan]]** — Sentinels oppose assassins on principle
- **[[House Medani]] vs [[House Lyrandar]]** — Inquisitors cannot regulate the unknowable
- **[[House Orien]] vs [[House Medani]]** — Tension between freedom of movement and internal control
- **[[House Sivis]] vs [[House Phiarlan]]** — Bureaucracy struggles to contain subterfuge

These tensions shape every high council vote, military deployment, and even the selection of provincial governors. Though open conflict between Houses is rare, few trust each other without reservation.
