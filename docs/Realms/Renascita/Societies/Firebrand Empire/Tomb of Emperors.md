The **Tomb of Emperors** is an ancient, sacred site where the last seven [[Emperors]]s of the [[Firebrand Empire]] are interred. Hidden deep beneath the surface, the tomb is accessible only through the empire's stargate, which is itself concealed within the tomb. Each emperor’s crypt is a reflection of their reign, personality, and contributions to the empire, and the entire complex is protected by advanced security systems and powerful guardians.


## Avenue of Sovereigns

- **Description**: The Avenue of Sovereigns is a long, grand corridor lined with statues of the emperors, each one towering and majestic. These statues are lifelike and imbued with powerful protective enchantments.
- **Security**: The statues themselves are the first line of defense, capable of coming to life and attacking intruders. They are programmed to recognize authorized individuals but will engage anyone else with extreme force. Additionally, the walls of the avenue are inscribed with glyphs that can trigger various magical traps, including barriers, energy blasts, and disorienting illusions.
