### Elder Marn

**Appearance:** Marn's appearance is distinctly marked by his deep blue scales, interwoven with streaks of silver. His eyes are soft, reflecting a life spent in contemplation and spiritual search. He wears a simple robe, but around his neck hangs a pendant of an ancient tree, symbolizing his deep connection to the spiritual paths of Aeloria.

**Greeting:** With a gentle incline of his head, Marn addresses the group. "Wisdom often whispers in the rustle of leaves and the murmur of streams. May your stories today resonate with the subtle truths that govern our existence."



## Corruption
- **Corruption Manifestation**: As corruption takes hold, Mernâ€™s serene demeanor is shattered. His once calm and contemplative nature becomes increasingly paranoid. The silver streaks in his scales, once symbols of wisdom, begin to dim, and his soft eyes grow hollow and restless. He starts questioning every decision, retreating into his mind, and seeing signs of doom in even the smallest events. His obsession with finding a solution becomes overwhelming, and he begins fixating on ancient prophecies, convinced that the only way to save the island is to enact drastic measures, even at great personal or moral cost.
- **Erratic Behavior**: Mern may become more reclusive, spending days in meditation that yield nothing but cryptic visions. He might abandon reason and logic, instead searching for esoteric rituals or forbidden knowledge, risking dangerous consequences in his desperation to heal the island.
