### Elder Sylthassi

**Appearance:** Elder Sylthassi is more diminutive than her counterparts, her scales a soft blue with a silvery luster. Her eyes are gentle but sharp, observing the world with a healer’s precision. She wears a simple tunic that flows like water, edged with silver threads that catch the light with every subtle movement, reflecting her connection to the healing waters of Aeloria.

**Greeting:** She offers the players a warm, reassuring smile. "It is the heart's courage and the [[soul]]'s compassion that truly tests us," she says softly. "May your tales today reflect not only valor but the wisdom of empathy and understanding."


## Corruption
- **Corruption Manifestation**: Sylthassi’s connection to healing begins to twist into something more desperate and obsessive. Her once gentle, sharp eyes now reflect a frantic need to "fix" things, leading her to experiment with darker, more dangerous forms of healing. The silvery luster of her scales starts to fade, becoming a dull grey, and her once flowing movements become erratic and sharp.
- **Erratic Behavior**: Sylthassi may resort to invasive, experimental treatments on the sick and injured, disregarding the risk of harm in her desperation to save the island. She may also start using her abilities to force others into compliance, believing she knows what's best, no matter the cost. Her empathy, once her greatest strength, is now overshadowed by her need to control life and death.
