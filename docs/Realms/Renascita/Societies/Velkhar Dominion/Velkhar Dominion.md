## Overview

The Velkhar Dominion is a mist-veiled nation ruled by a caste of oath-bound vampires, offering stability, protection, and order in exchange for loyalty and blood. Though feudal and rigid, the Dominion is not cruel — its hierarchy is clear, its laws are honored, and its undead nobility are guardians as much as rulers.

At its heart lies [[Calvereth]], a quiet and disciplined city built in a valley. The living dwell alongside the dead in a mutual pact of survival, shielded from [[Entropy|aberrant corruption]] by arcane mists and ancient [[Glyph Magic]].

The Dominion is ruled by [[Vaelira Lyrandar|Vaelira]], *The Lady of Velkhar* — a former scion of [[House Lyrandar]] who cast aside her name to become something other: immortal, veiled, and just. She is spoken of with reverence and caution, a figure of myth and law whose presence anchors the nation’s long vigil.
