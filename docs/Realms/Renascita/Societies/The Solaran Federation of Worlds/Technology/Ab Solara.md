*Gateways of Light, Folded [[Weave]], and [[Solaran]] Ambition*

---

## Overview  
The **Ab Solara** were the primary transportation and communication infrastructure of the [[Solaran]]—a vast, arcano-mechanical network of gates that allowed near-instantaneous travel across continents, planes, and even distant worlds. Each gate harnessed solar and planar energy to fold the [[Weave]] itself, forming temporary corridors through reality.

To the [[Solaran|Solarans]], the Ab Solara were more than mere logistics—they were a testament to their mastery of both arcane theory and cosmic mechanics.

---

## Structure and Design  
An Ab Solara is typically composed of:

- A **circular or octagonal portal ring**, etched with [[Solaran]] runes and embedded with calibrated **[[Sun Topaz]]** capacitors.
- An **arcanometric control pedestal**, which housed planar maps, resonance settings, and security glyphs.
- A **focusing core**, often constructed from [[Solaran Obsidian]], used to stabilize the spatial fold and contain its energetic backlash.
- A **fold anchor**, rooted in both magical ley convergence and a physical support lattice, ensuring the gate’s orientation across realms.

Most Ab Solara stations were housed within enclosed sanctums, watchtowers, or research facilities—protected by [[Sentinel Orders]] or automated constructs.

## Functionality  

Activating an Ab Solara required vast amounts of magical energy and precise alignment of [[Weave|the Weave]]. Only trained [[Solartificers]] and gate-adepts could operate them safely.

### Primary Functions:

- **Transit Hubs**: Major Ab Solara rings were used like **train stations**, moving people and goods between key cities and regions.
- **Industrial Pipelines**: Smaller gates existed near mines, research sites, and arcanofactories to rapidly transport resources to processing centers.
- **Planar Access Points**: Some specialized Ab Solara were attuned to the **Elemental Planes**, [[Sigmora]], and even the now-severed paths to [[Thargrun]].

## Risks and Side Effects  

The power required to fold [[Weave|the Weave]] created a number of **arcane hazards**, particularly when poorly calibrated or corrupted:

- **[[Weave]] Destabilization**: Prolonged gate use thins the local [[Weave]], creating zones where magic functions erratically.
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Rarely, travelers who take the “long path” through an unstable corridor may emerge **seconds, hours, or years** after they entered.
- **[[Soul]] Flickering**: Improper transitions can cause the traveler’s [[soul]]-thread to desynchronize from their body. The [[Solaran|Solarans]] developed countermeasures, but some experimental routes were deemed too dangerous to use regularly.

Because of these dangers, **each Ab Solara was sacred**, regulated, and attuned to a precise set of destination harmonics. Unauthorized use was considered reckless and, in some cases, heretical.

---

## Cultural and Strategic Significance  

To the [[Solaran|Solarans]], the Ab Solara represented:

- **A unifying force** across the empire, connecting cities, minds, and cultures
- **A divine mirror** of the [[soul]] cycle: entering, folding, and emerging anew
- **A sacred trust**, powered by the essence of the sun itself

After the fall of the [[Endless Sun]], many gates became dormant or unstable. Some still flicker with residual power—beckoning adventurers to forgotten places.

## Known Gate Destinations  

The Ab Solara network included connections to:

- [[Solara]] (Capital Core)
- [[Cascadia]] (Sun Topaz refinery near the Eternal Flame)
- [[Arcane Observatory]] (geostationary research station)
- [[docs/Races/Solaran/Mokoweri]] (sealed within [[Irasandra]]’s influence)
- [[Elementis Ignis]], [[Elementis Aqua]], [[Elementis Terra]], [[Elementis Ventus]] (Elemental planes)
- [[Thargrun]] (pre-severance)
- [[Sigmora]] (plane of order, maintained only by automated gate-cycles)

## Modern Use  

Today, the remaining Ab Solara structures are either:

- **Ruins** buried beneath jungle, sand, or ash
- **Sealed sanctums**, maintained by splinter [[Solaran]] cultures or secret custodians like the [[Ferrun]]

Their power is coveted. Their cost is often forgotten.
