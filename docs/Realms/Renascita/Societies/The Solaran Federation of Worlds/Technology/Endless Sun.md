The Endless Sun was a machine designed to ensure balance in the universe. They believed that the finite number of souls in existence was essential to the stability of existence, and that the natural cycle of birth, life, and death was a fundamental component of that balance.

However, when the [[Machinery of Death]] began to malfunction and souls were no longer being reborn, the Solarans recognized the catastrophic consequences that this could bring. Without souls re-entering the universe, the existing cycle would become increasingly unbalanced, leading to stagnation and nothingness.

In response, the Solarans sought to create the Endless Sun, a new source of life energy that could sustain the universe and ensure the continued transmigration of souls. They believed that this was the only way to restore balance and prevent the impending collapse of existence. The endless sun drew it's energy from the cosmos itself. Orbiting the sun as an artificial moon drawing on the energy of the Star itself.
