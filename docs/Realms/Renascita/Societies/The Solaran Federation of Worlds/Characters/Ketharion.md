# The Last Sun Speaker
Ketharion is a towering figure, standing over 9 feet tall, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. His skin is a deep, rich brown, and his eyes are a piercing golden hue that seem to glow in the right light. He has a bald head with a long, thick beard that hangs down to his chest, giving him an almost regal appearance.

Ketharion is adorned in the traditional robes of the [[Solaran]] priesthood, with a long, flowing white robe that drapes down to his feet and a golden sash tied around his waist. He carries with him a staff, adorned with intricate, golden symbols, which serves as a symbol of his position as a high priest and as a tool for channeling his magical abilities.

Despite his imposing size, Ketharion is known for his gentle demeanor and his calm, measured approach to problem-solving. He is highly intelligent and well-educated, with a deep understanding of [[Solaran]] culture, history, and magic. He is deeply respected by the [[Solaran]] people and is seen as a wise and just leader.

"Greetings, travelers. As you access the records on this ancient command console, you will gain insight into the [[Solaran|Solarans]]' understanding of the [[machinery of death]] and their quest to create the endless sun. Remember, the endless sun was not merely about attaining immortality, but about ensuring balance in the universe. It was an ambitious project that ultimately failed, leading to the downfall of our civilization. But in our failure lies a lesson: the delicate balance of life and death must be respected and upheld. Use this knowledge wisely and with great care, for the fate of the universe is in your hands. May the endless sun shine upon you."
