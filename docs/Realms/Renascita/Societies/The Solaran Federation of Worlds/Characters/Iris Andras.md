## Mythos
Over the centuries, as Iris Andras' deeds were passed down in legends and lore, her name transformed and evolved with each retelling. In ancient texts, she may have been referred to as "Isara Andira," emphasizing the importance of her role as a master bio-engineer. As time went on, her name might have morphed into "Isaraundra," invoking a sense of mystery and reverence. In later tales, she could have been known as "Isarandria," symbolizing the depth of her knowledge and wisdom.

Legends and folklore tend to embellish and reinterpret historical figures, and Iris Andras' name would have been no exception.

Today marks a significant step in my research. The experiments with the flora of Mokoweri have yielded fascinating results. The plants here, deeply influenced by [[Weave|the weave]] and the ancient cosmic forces, exhibit unparalleled resilience and vitality. Yet, there is still a missing piece to this puzzle—a secret that eludes me.

I've documented the alterations in the plant life meticulously, but the larger picture remains elusive. It's as if we're observing the branches of a tree without understanding the roots. The connection between life, [[Weave|the weave]], and the [[machinery of death]] still escapes my grasp.

I must delve deeper into the research, searching for that elusive link that binds them all together. The Solaran people deserve nothing less than a complete understanding of their existence.

Three years of tireless experimentation, and I'm still no closer to unraveling the ultimate mystery of life and [[soul]] protection. The bioluminescent flora, the vibrant fauna—all of Mokoweri's wonders—are a testament to the harmony between [[Weave|the weave]] and life. But my pursuit to safeguard Solaran souls remains unfulfilled.

The aberrant [[soul]] infusions persist, resisting all attempts at a reversal. It's maddening to witness the corruption of something so sacred. There must be an answer, a solution that balances [[Weave|the weave]] and restores purity to these souls.

I'm left with no choice but to push forward. Perhaps, in the depths of the embered caverns, I'll discover the missing piece of this intricate puzzle. The Solaran people are counting on me.

**Personal Log Entry #3**


The experiments in the embered caverns continue, but the breakthrough I seek remains elusive. The ancient Solaran technology within this chamber holds untold potential, yet it withholds its secrets as steadfastly as ever.

I've grown weary of the endless trials and errors, the countless hours spent in isolation, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. But I cannot relent. The aberrant [[soul]] infusions persist, casting a shadow over the Solaran people's fate. I must succeed where others have failed.

I've come to realize that this task requires more than mere intellect and scientific prowess. It demands a sacrifice, a profound connection with [[Weave|the weave]] itself. Only by becoming one with [[Weave|the weave]] can I hope to protect the souls of my people.

**Personal Log Entry #4**

The realization is both daunting and exhilarating—I must become the guardian of [[Weave|the weave]], the protector of Solaran souls. To achieve this, I shall bind myself to the heart of Mokoweri's life force, the ancient Gaian tree. [[Irasandra]], as I have named her, will be the vessel through which my essence and [[Weave|the weave]] intertwine.

The decision is not without trepidation, for such a bond is irreversible. Yet, the destiny of the Solaran people hangs in the balance. I shall embrace this destiny willingly, accepting the mantle of a Grove Shaper, an immortal guardian of both life and the [[machinery of death]].

This path is not without its sacrifices, but it is a path I choose for the greater good. May my actions resonate through [[Weave|the weave]], protecting the souls of the Solaran people for all eternity.



## When the players Meet [[Irasandra]] / Iris Andras

The binding ritual is complete. I am now one with [[Irasandra]], the living Gaian tree that spans the millennia of Mokoweri's existence. My essence resonates with [[Weave|the weave]], and I feel the pulse of life flowing through the island.

My newfound connection has unlocked powers beyond comprehension. I can touch every leaf, whisper through the winds, and nurture the souls of my people. [[Weave|The weave]] itself responds to my will, safeguarding Solaran souls and guiding the [[machinery of death]].
