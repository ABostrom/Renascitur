## [[Varkhaal Bloodlash|Varkhaal, the Broken-Jawed]]

Once a formidable hobgoblin general of unmatched discipline, Varkhaal Bloodlash became the founding prophet of the [[Weavers of Agony]] after vanishing into [[The World Beneath]] and returning transformed. He now bears the title **The Broken-Jawed**, after shattering his own jaw in a ritual act of devotion to [[Arachnie, the Matriarch of Pain]]. The wound never healed—by choice—and remains a constant conduit for her whispers.

Varkhaal is equal parts warlord, prophet, and martyr. His body is ravaged by self-inflicted wounds and arachnid mutations, yet he radiates a terrifying charisma. His sermons are delivered through blood-choked, reverent growls, interpreted by his closest seers.
