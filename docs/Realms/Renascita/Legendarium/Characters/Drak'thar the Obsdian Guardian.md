_Species_: Ancient Obsidian Dragon

_Age_: Millennia-old

_Appearance_: Drak'thar is a colossal creature with gleaming, obsidian-black scales that shimmer like polished onyx. Its eyes emit an otherworldly glow, appearing like twin stars amidst the darkness of its countenance. The dragon's wings, each spanning the length of a small ship, are formidable in their own right. Jagged spines adorn its back and tail, giving it a fearsome yet regal appearance.

_Personality_: Drak'thar is a guardian of great wisdom and solemn duty. Its demeanor is reserved, and it exudes an air of ancient authority. While initially cautious and protective, the dragon is not devoid of compassion. It values the well-being of Mokoweri and possesses a deep understanding of its role in preserving the island from aberrant threats.

_Background_: Drak'thar's history is intertwined with that of the [[Solaran]] civilization. Millennia ago, the [[Solaran|Solarans]] entrusted this ancient obsidian dragon with the sacred duty of guarding the [[Solaran]] research facility. Over countless generations, Drak'thar has stood sentinel, ensuring that the secrets contained within remain safe.

_Abilities_: Drak'thar possesses formidable physical and magical abilities. Its breath weapon, a torrent of obsidian flames, can decimate foes with its fiery intensity. The dragon's immense strength and durability make it a nearly unbeatable adversary in combat. Additionally, Drak'thar commands ancient, arcane powers that hint at its deep connection to [[Solaran]] magic.

_Alliance_: Despite its initially guarded disposition, Drak'thar has formed an alliance with a group of adventurers seeking to protect Mokoweri and prevent the release of an imprisoned mind flayer within the [[Solaran]] research facility. This partnership is built on mutual trust and a shared goal of safeguarding the island from aberrant incursions.

_Purpose_: Drak'thar's primary purpose is to safeguard the [[Solaran]] research facility and ensure that the ancient mind flayer remains sealed within. Its sense of duty is unwavering, and it understands the dire consequences that could arise should the mind flayer be set free.

This Ancient Obsidian Dragon is designed to be a formidable opponent for high-level parties, offering a mix of physical and magical challenges. Adjustments can be made to better fit the encounter within your campaign's story and the party's strength.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Ancient Obsidian Dragon can take lair actions to cause environmental effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Lava Lob:** The dragon causes the ground to tremble as it channels the molten core's power, lobbing chunks of lava at one or two points it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the dragon's next turn.
    
- **Obsidian Spikes:** The dragon summons sharp obsidian spikes from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature moving into or within the area on their turn must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
    
- **Smoke Cloud:** The dragon releases a thick cloud of smoke from its nostrils, filling a 60-foot radius around it. The area is heavily obscured until the end of the dragon's next turn. Each creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or spend its action this turn coughing and wheezing.
    

These lair actions reflect the dragon's control over its volcanic lair and its ability to manipulate the environment to its advantage. They add an element of unpredictability and require players to be strategic about their positioning and movements during the encounter.
