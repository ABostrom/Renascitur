## Location

[[Solaran Obsidian]] is no longer found in nature. It is a **refined material**, a product of Solaran artifice and divine metallurgy. Crafted originally from raw [[Radiant Obsidian]], it was forged in the starforges and sanctum-laboratories of the [[Solaran]], especially in the time of their alliance with [[Muradin]] during [[the First Age]].

Fragments and intact plates of it can still be found deep within ruined Solaran cities, forgotten vaults, or built into the latticework of containment fields and lightforges.

## Description

Smooth and unnaturally precise, [[Solaran Obsidian]] glows faintly from within, pulsing with radiant amber and crimson light. Unlike its chaotic parent, it is **cold to the touch**, yet **thrums with restrained power**. [[Solaran]] geometric glyphs are often etched into its surface, some still active after millennia.

## Properties

- **Stabilized Radiance**: It channels divine or arcane energy with immense precision, resisting overload or aberrant corruption.
- **Containment Matrix**: Frequently used to construct prisons, barriers, and null-fields capable of resisting psychic and planar intrusion.

## Uses

- Core component of [[Solaran]] energy conduits, divine reactors, and sacred vaults.
- Used in the construction of [[Hexweave Pylons]] and other aberrant-resistant latticework through [[Arcanometry]].  

## Relationship to [[Radiant Obsidian]]

[[Solaran Obsidian]] is **not a natural substance**, but the **refined and stabilized form** of [[Radiant Obsidian]].

> Where Radiant Obsidian burns with divine purpose, Solaran Obsidian harnesses that purpose.  
> It is godflame made tool — sacred fury shaped into function.

Crafting Solaran Obsidian required a unique fusion of Solaran solarforging and [[Muradin]]’s runes of containment. Its recipe has been lost to time, but its legacy lives on in the deepest bones of the world.

## Lore
In the present day, [[Solaran Obsidian]] has become a sought-after relic for collectors, scholars, and art enthusiasts. The knowledge of its creation has been largely lost with the fall of the [[Solaran]] civilization, making existing pieces highly valuable and enigmatic.
