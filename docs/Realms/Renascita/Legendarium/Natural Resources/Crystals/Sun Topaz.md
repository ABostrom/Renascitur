## Location  
[[Sun Topaz]] occurs **naturally in the land surrounding [[the Eternal Flame]]**, crystallized from molten stone infused with divine radiance. These raw stones are embedded in the obsidian veins and golden faults of the region, glowing faintly even underground.

The [[Solaran]] were the first to recognize its potential, mining and refining [[Sun Topaz]] for use across their civilization. Today, it is most often found in **Solaran ruins**, embedded in broken latticework, containment cores, or lightforged devices — but its **origin is the sacred heart of the [[Flamebound]] homeland**.

## Description  
A luminous gold gemstone that retains a subtle inner warmth, even in shadow. When exposed to direct sunlight, it glows brighter, and pulses slowly — almost like breath. Fully charged Sun Topaz radiates a steady light and is warm to the touch, emitting soft solar harmonics when set in arcane devices.

Its color ranges from honey-gold to deep amber, and its structure holds radiant energy in tightly woven crystalline filaments.

## Properties  
- **Solar Absorption**: Stores solar energy passively over time, increasing with duration and exposure.
- **Energy Reservoir**: Can release stored energy into arcane, divine, or technological systems.
- **Radiant Pulse**: Emits flashes of heat and light when overcharged or shattered.

## Uses  
- Used by the [[Solaran]] to power skyforges, radiant engines, and containment pylons.
- Integrated into [[Flameforging]] rituals as a stabilizer for divine flame and radiant runes.
- Carried by [[Flamebound]] navigators and seers as a symbol of guidance, illumination, and balance.

## Lore  
[[Sun Topaz]] is one of the few known materials to form naturally in proximity to divine energy. Found in the stone near [[the Eternal Flame]], it is believed to be crystallized essence — a manifestation of **pure solar intent** fused with the bones of the world.

The [[Solaran]] were the first to harness its power, learning to cut and align the gem’s latticework for use in radiant machinery. Over time, [[Sun Topaz]] became synonymous with Solaran civilization — a beacon of light, invention, and celestial harmony.
