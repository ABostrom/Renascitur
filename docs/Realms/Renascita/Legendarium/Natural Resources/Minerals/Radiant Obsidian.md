## Location  
Found only at the heart of [[the Eternal Flame]], [[Radiant Obsidian]] forms where divine fire meets primordial earth. It is not mined — it is born, cooled into being from flame that remembers the shape of purpose. The deepest crucibles beneath the Flameforges may yield slivers, but only with ritual, reverence, and risk.

## Description  
[[Radiant Obsidian]] is a sleek, mirror-like black glass that gleams faintly with prismatic veins of gold and violet light. The surface feels warm to the touch, and staring into it for too long may bring visions — or madness. It sings in the presence of fire and hums faintly when touched by sunlight.

## Properties  
- Resistant to extreme heat and pressure; shatters only with divine will or corrupted energy.  
- Emits soft radiance in complete darkness; pulses in rhythm with nearby flame.  
- Reacts to intent: becomes more reflective in the hands of the focused, more chaotic in the hands of the uncertain.

## Uses  
- Used in [[Flameforging]] to create relics, lenses, and weapon cores for the [[Flamebound]].  
- Integral to high ceremonial tools and flame-channeling constructs.  
- When refined through [[Solaran]] techniques, it produces [[Solaran Obsidian]] — a material vital to containment technology and ancient starforges.
