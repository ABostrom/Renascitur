## Location  
Mined from beneath the ancient glacial veins surrounding [[The Pulsecore]], [[Stillstone Ore]] is buried deep within bedrock frozen since [[the First Age]]. It is found only in the coldest vaults of the north, where silence is thick enough to press against the skin and the ice never melts.

## Description  
[[Stillstone Ore]] appears as a dull, blue-gray mineral with veins of pale white that glow faintly under moonlight. It is unnaturally heavy, and it absorbs sound around it, creating a strange aura of quiet. The [[Icebound]] believe the ore was touched by the wound of [[Zaratan]], the stillness buried at the heart of the world, and treat it with reverence.

## Properties  
- Absorbs sound and vibration, creating a muffling aura around stored chunks.
- Extremely brittle in warmth, but nearly indestructible at sub-zero temperatures.
- Harmonizes naturally with [[Iceforging]] techniques and runes of stillness.

## Uses  
- Smelted into [[Icevein Steel]], where it enhances silence and resilience.
- Crushed into dust and used in coldwarding enchantments and armor linings.
- Kept raw and carved into echo-dampening talismans or grave-seals in Icebound tombs.
