# [[Salt Hardened Steel]]

## Location  
Forged in the coastal depths of [[Draumhavn]], beneath the watchful shadow of [[The Wakened Trench]], [[Salt Hardened Steel]] is made from base iron alloyed with threads of [[Abyssal Iron]] and quenched in brine steeped with powdered [[Deepsea Coral]]. It is shaped by the ancient craft of [[Tideforging]].

## Description  
[[Salt Hardened Steel]] is a dark, blue-gray metal laced with gleaming streaks of silvery white â€” veins of crystallized mineral from the brine-infused forging process. Each piece hums faintly near water and resists the pull of rust. Crafted through [[Tideforging]], this steel is tempered in salt spray, forged at low heat, and then left to season in tidal caverns for weeks before it is hardened. It is said to "grow teeth" in time, becoming sharper and harder the longer it is submerged in sea air.

## Properties  
- Grows more resilient with age, especially in marine climates.
- Slightly self-repairing in saltwater exposure, sealing microfractures.
- Resonates subtly in proximity to deep water, trenches, or bound voids.

## Uses  
- Used in naval armor, wave-forged spears, sea-breathing diving suits, and binding chains for sea-beasts.
- Blades made from it are prized by abyssal hunters and coastal defenders.
- Combined with [[Deepsea Coral]] to create weapons that echo underwater or reverberate through the minds of deep-dwelling threats.
