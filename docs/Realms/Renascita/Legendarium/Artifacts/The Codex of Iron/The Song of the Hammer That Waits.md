# The Song of the Hammer That Waits

_Carved at the twilight of Runehart, when all was nearly lost_

---

The forge dimmed. The flame whispered.

[[Muradin]] stood alone in the deep,  
his hand upon the Anvil of Eternity,  
his mind adrift among futures yet to come.

He saw the echo of his name in a child not yet born.  
A [[soul]] shaped not by stone, but by sorrow.  
An heir who would forget the forge,  
and only by breaking it, learn its truth.

To this heir, [[Muradin]] left no command.  
Only the Codex. Only the song.

Three songs for three ages.

A beginning, a burden, and a waiting blow.

The hammer waits.  
The fire endures.

When the last seal trembles,  
and the sky splits like ore before the strikeâ€”  
let the heir find the Codex.  
Let the Anvil ring once more.

And may the world be reforged.

*This is the final song. Its end is unwritten.*
