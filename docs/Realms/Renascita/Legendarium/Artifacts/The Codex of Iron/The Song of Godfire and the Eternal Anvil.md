In the days before Runehart, when the Grundthain still knelt at the feet of the elemental gods, Muradin stood apart. He had seen the pacts unravel. He had watched as Phenos burned without boundary, as Zaratan grew still with sorrow, as Tempus roared with madness, and Leviathan hungered without end.

He spoke of change. They called him a heretic. He preached restraint. They called him weak.

But Muradin was not broken. He was awakening.

And so he cast off his station. He set down his crown, his name, his lineage. With nothing but an unmarked hammer and a satchel of raw, unscribed runes, he walked into the world—not to shape it, but to **listen**.

He would leave behind the rituals of the Grundthain and seek the deeper truth, the forge beneath all others.

### Across the Elemental Planes

He passed through the scorched fields of the southern calderas, where the breath of **Phenos** still curled in the stones. He tempered his body in flame, and his spirit in restraint. There he learned the rune of **Containment**, the binding fire turned inward.

He crossed the storm-haunted skybridges in the east, where thunder never ceased and the lightning had memory. Within the roaring wind, he traced the rune of **Judgement**—not swift, but earned.

He descended into the ice-choked veins of the northern wastes, where the whispers of **Zaratan’s** pain echoed in the frost. Beneath glaciers older than thought, he found silence and carved the rune of **Stillness**.

And in the west, where the tides crashed against the black cliffs of the drowned, he waded into the trenches that drank the sun. There he heard the hunger of **Leviathan** and withstood it. From this, he shaped the rune of **Weight**.

The runes were not taught. They were not gifted.

He **earned** them—each one a scar, each one a revelation.

### The Revelation of Aetherium

In the heart of a crater where the sky once fell, Muradin found **Aetherium**.

A metal not of earth, nor flame, but of the firmament itself—cooled starlight, veined with raw potential.

It sang to him. Not in words, but in **patterns**. Each ingot hummed with unwritten runes—possibilities, unshaped destinies. Muradin did not smelt it. He **listened**. He mapped its grain like a cartographer of divine secrets.

To shape Aetherium, he had to unlearn the hammer’s pride.

Each strike was a prayer.

Each quenching, a breath drawn from the dying echo of the Forge Eternal.

### The Calling of the World-Forger

And then, in the deepest quiet—beneath the world’s foundation—he met the echo of **Tharamos**, the Unyielding Stone. The god did not speak. The stone pressed against his soul.

Muradin did not ask for permission.

He laid his hand upon the bedrock and listened.

He saw the shape of the world’s bones. The fractures. The scars. The strength waiting to be reforged.

He understood then that the world itself was a forge—and he, its hammer.

And in that moment, the language of the **Aeternum** revealed itself.

He saw runes beyond the runes.

He saw truth written in the spaces between.

### The Founding of Runehart

It was then, and only then, that he returned to the mountains.

He chose the highest peak, where no god had tread.

There he struck the first rune into stone. And the mountain sang.

Runehart was not built. It was **called** into being.

A city not of worship, but of purpose.

A forge not of flame, but of memory.

And at its heart, Muradin would birth something greater than all his kin had ever known.

### The Birth of the Anvil

Within the deepest chambers of Runehart—where flame met memory, and silence held its breath—Muradin turned his forge to its final task.

He had walked the world. He had listened to the bones of the land. He had carved the truth into stone, and now, with hands shaped by vision and sacrifice, he began to forge a weapon unlike any other.

The **Anvil of Eternity** was not hammered into being—it was summoned. Not by command, but by communion.

Muradin gathered the Aetherium he had shaped by whisper and will. He did not bend it. He bargained with it. Each piece asked him a question. Each strike answered with meaning.

The first rune he carved upon the anvil was **Unmaking**—to sever the divine from the mortal.

The second was **Memory**—so that those who struck upon it would remember why.

The last was **Sacrifice**—a mark he forged with his own blood.

The Anvil gleamed with stillness. With finality. With truth.

He did not call his kin to witness it.

He did not proclaim its completion.

He simply placed it at the mountain’s heart, and the forge fell silent.

For the time had not yet come.

Let those who seek to wield it know this:

- _[[Aetherium]] yields only to those who kneel before their failures._
- _Runes are not tools, but oaths made solid._
- _To forge a god-slaying weapon is to bleed a truth so deep it scars the world._
- _The world itself is a crucible. You are not above it—you are within it._

Strike not to conquer.
Strike not to avenge.
Strike to **end**.
And may your final blow be your finest work.
