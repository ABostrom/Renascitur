**Before the first chisel struck the stone, before the first fire burned in the forge, there was nothing.**  
A silence vast and empty, stretching beyond all measure. No mountain stood, no river ran, no sky arched above. All was void, waiting for a hand mighty enough to shape it.

Then came [[Tharamos]], the Unyielding Stone, the first and greatest of the Makers.

He rose from the abyss with a hammer in his hand and an anvil at his feet, and with the first strike of his will, he **shattered the silence**. Sparks flew from his forge, and the first stones of the world took shape.

Where his hammer fell, **mountains rose**.  
Where his chisel carved, **valleys were made**.  

The bones of the world were laid, strong and enduring, unbroken by time or tide.

But the stone was cold, and the fire was still. The world had form, but not motion, and so **[[Tharamos]] called for his brother, [[Valtor]], the Endless Tide**.

### **The Waters and the Fire**

From the far edges of the world, where the sea had no shore, **[[Valtor]] answered**. He brought forth the first rain, carving great rivers through the mountains and filling the deep places with the song of the waves.

He cast the tides upon the earth, giving the world its rhythm, its motion, its breath.

Yet still, the world lay in darkness.

Then came **[[Aelion]], the Everburning Light**, who strode forth with flames upon his brow and fire in his hands. He kindled the sun-forges in the sky, setting them to burn for all time.

He melted the ice and turned stone to molten ore, filling the deep places with his fire. And thus, the great forges of the world were born, their embers burning with the first heat of creation.

### **The Verdant [[Soul]]**

Yet still, the world was barren. The stone was strong, the rivers swift, the fires hot—but nothing grew.

It was then that **[[Sylara]], the Verdant [[Soul]]**, stepped forth, hands weaving life into the world.

From the cracks in the stone, **roots took hold**, twisting through the mountains, binding the rivers, softening the earth.  
From the deep places, she called forth **beasts, birds, and creeping things**, and from the sky, she spun the breath of the wind.

Now the world had form. It had strength, it had motion, it had fire, and it had life. But still, there were none to shape it, none to guide it.

### **The Birth of the Keepers**

So **[[Tharamos]] took up his hammer once more**, and upon his anvil, he forged the **first of the Grundthain**.

From stone, he carved them, their backs broad and their hands strong, their hearts filled with the fire of the forge. **To them, he gave knowledge of the runes, so they might shape the world as he had.**

**[[Valtor]] cast the first of the humans** upon the shifting tides, giving them the gift of motion, change, and boundless potential.

**[[Aelion]] breathed light into the first Solarans**, making them brilliant and wise, attuned to the great forges of the heavens.

**[[Sylara]] wove the Kyojin from the threads of the world itself**, binding them to the [[soul]] of all living things, making them the keepers of the wild places.

Thus, the world was set in its order, and the Makers stepped back to watch their work unfold.

### **The Shattering and the Betrayer**

Yet the darkness had not been undone.

From the void beyond the forge, from the nothingness that hated the hammer’s song, came **[[Ishna]], the Unmaker**.

She was the hunger that devours, the silence that swallows, the rot that weakens. She crept into the hearts of the first mortals, whispering of things that **unravel instead of build, that shatter instead of forge**.

She **split stone**, turned rivers **to dust**, made fire **consume all it touched**. She was the **crack in the anvil, the flaw in the steel, the rust upon the forge**.

**[[Tharamos]] saw this and knew the world would not stand unless it was sealed.**

He raised his hammer one last time, and with a final, shattering blow, he **split the world from the void**, forging the great boundary that would keep [[Ishna]] at bay.

But the crack remained, hidden deep in the heart of the world.

And so he gave the [[Grundthain]] their purpose:

**To hold the line against the Unmaker.**  
**To guard the sacred runes and keep the foundation strong.**  
**To stand unyielding, as the world’s first Maker had.**

For the stone may crack, the fire may dim, the waters may wane, and the trees may wither—**but the forge endures.**

And so long as the hammer rings, the world shall stand.
