The **[[Soul]] Engine** is a forbidden fusion of [[Solaran]] [[Astral Weaving|Soul Magic]], [[Ferrun]] craftsmanship and [[Astral Weaving]]. It is a construct designed to anchor a [[soul]] to a mortal body when the natural cycle of life and death has failed. Unlike necromantic reanimation, which forcibly binds a [[soul]] against its will, the [[Soul]] Engine acts as a **synthetic afterlife tether**, preserving the [[soul]]'s integrity within a contained system.


### **Function and Mechanisms**

The [[Soul]] Engine is **not a mere power source**—it is a **living mechanism**, designed to maintain the delicate balance between a mortal vessel and an anchored [[soul]]. Its core components include:

- **The [[Solaran Obsidian|Obsidian]] Core** – A lattice of **[[Solaran Obsidian|Obsidian]] and [[Arcanometry|arcanometric]] crystal**, functioning as a stabilizing medium. Obsidian’s unique property of absorbing and retaining magical energy makes it ideal for containing [[soul]] fragments without decay.
- **[[Nox Lapis]] Resonance Field** – A crystalline framework surrounding the core, acting as a spiritual conduit. This field constantly recalibrates to harmonize the [[soul]]'s essence with the host body, preventing rejection.
- **The [[Ferrun]] Binding Matrix** – A system of engraved **runic inscriptions**, derived from Ferrun research into [[soul]] entrapment. This matrix ensures that the [[soul]] does not become untethered or fragmented over time.
- **The Astral Anchor** – An ethereal tether, often requiring a powerful **astral weaver** (such as [[Lyria Solvayne]]) to forge a direct link between the [[soul]] and the device. This process is **painful, dangerous, and irreversible**.
