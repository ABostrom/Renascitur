## Age of Twilight’s Convergence

The Second Age marks the desperate struggle of mortals to resist the creeping entropy left in the wake of Solara’s fall. It is a time of fractured unity, relentless war, and sacrifice on a scale the world had never seen.

In the beginning, the [[Elder Races]] rebuild. The Kyojin fracture after a great spiritual [[Psychic Schism|schism]], dividing into the noble Leonin and the primal Orcs. Their war devastates the spirit of their people, breaking their connection to their World Tree and the goddess [[Sylara]].

In the West, Runehart becomes a sanctuary of knowledge and resistance. [[Muradin]], now an elemental immortal, spreads his teachings and seals the corrupted Grundthain [[Typhon, The Archon of Death|Typhon]] into a cursed blade with the Anvil of Eternity. But Runehart collapses soon after, and the weapon is lost.

Elsewhere, [[Vecna]] rises. A mortal scholar and arcanist, he invents **Arcanometry** — the science of magic without gods. When he learns that [[Ishna]] is corrupting mortal souls, he delves into necromancy in an attempt to create beings that cannot be touched by entropy. Thus are born the **Forgeborn**, beginning with his own son, Hephaestus.

As aberrant Solaran remnants awaken and entire planes fall to entropy, the **Forge Wars** erupt. Forgeborn legions, undead titans, corrupted soulforges, and [[Quintumvirate|God Hand]] clash in a war that spans seven realms.

In his final act, [[Vecna]] sacrifices millions of souls across six planes and the mortal world to power the **Hexweave Pylons**, sealing [[Ishna]] in a timeless void. But in his moment of triumph, he is betrayed by **Kas**, his most loyal general — now corrupted by the **Blade of [[Typhon, The Archon of Death|Typhon]]**.

Kas slays [[Vecna]] and becomes the first vampire, severing the world’s last link to divine intervention.

The Hexweave Pylons remain. [[The Forge Wars]] end. The world enters a fragile peace bought through horrors it barely remembers.

**Thus ends the Second Age — not with triumph, but with silence.**
