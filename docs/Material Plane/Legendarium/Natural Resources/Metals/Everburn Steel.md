## Location  
[[Everburn Steel]] cannot be mined — it must be **forged** through sacred [[Flameforging]] rituals within the heart of the Eternal Flame. The process combines shards of [[Radiant Obsidian]], infused with molten [[Sun Topaz]], and sacred dwarven steel inscribed with the oldest [[Muradin|Muradinic]] runes of containment and devotion.

Only the most experienced [[Flamebound]] forgemasters are permitted to attempt its creation, and only during the rare alignments when the Flame sings.

## Description  
[[Everburn Steel]] is a dark-gold alloy, veined with threads of obsidian and radiant light. Even when at rest, it glows faintly—pulsing like a living forge. Its surface bears ancient runes that shift subtly under divine flame, and it is always warm to the touch.

When struck, it rings like a choir of bells trapped in stone. When drawn, it sheds shadow. When broken—if ever broken—it weeps light.

## Properties  
- **Self-Warming**: Never cools fully; retains divine heat unless quenched by aberrant void.
- **Rune-Conductive**: Accepts and sustains complex rune-sequences beyond mortal alloys.
- **Aberration-Resistant**: Repels corruption and entropy when properly inscribed.

## Uses  
- Forging of relic-blades, hallowed tools, and sacred bindings by the [[Flamebound]].
- Integrated into the structure of the Eternal Flame’s pylons and temple-forges.
- Used to reinforce the bindings around the divine heart — not to seal, but to crown.

## Lore  
[[Everburn Steel]] is more than a metal. It is **devotion made solid**, **radiance bound**, **purpose tempered**. It represents the perfect communion between dwarven craft and [[Solaran]] light—the echo of a covenant struck during the First Age.

Where the other clans bind the remnants of broken elementals, the [[Flamebound]] do not seal — they **serve**. And [[Everburn Steel]] is the blade and burden of that service.

> “Let it never cool. Let it never forget. Let it burn, so we do not.” — [[Forgemaster Loras, Keeper of the Core Flame]]
