## Location  
Forged deep beneath the [[The Pulsecore|Pulsecore]] by the [[Icebound]], [[Icevein Steel]] is smelted from refined iron mixed with threads of [[Stillstone Ore]], drawn from veins laced with pale blue minerals that resonate with silence and dormancy.

## Description  
[[Icevein Steel]] is a haunting alloy of gray-blue iron shot through with ghostly white veins. It hums faintly when held in cold air, and its surface remains cold to the touch even in warm environments. Shaped through the art of [[Iceforging]], it is not quenched in fire, but slow-formed through glacial pressure, runic vibration, and stillness. It carries the weight of silence — both a shield and a sentence.

## Properties  
- Dampens sound and vibration; blades made from it can cut without echo.
- Resistant to magical fire and ambient heat.
- Grows colder with use; some say it "feeds" on breath or warmth.

## Uses  
- Used to forge weapons for ghostwalkers, iceguard, and tombbound sentinels.
- Armor made from it suppresses noise and grants an eerie calm to the wearer.
- When combined with [[Frost Diamond]], it forms some of the most feared relic-blades of the [[Icebound]] — silent, perfect, and remorseless.
