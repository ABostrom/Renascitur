## Location  
Mined from glacial pockets and resonant chambers beneath the [[Pulsecore]], deep within the ice-wrought tunnels of the [[Icebound]] holds. It is found where the glacier itself pulses with faint, rhythmic vibrations.

## Description  
Also known as *Frostglass* to traders and surface dwellers, [[Frost Diamond]] is a pale, semi-translucent crystal with fine latticework visible within. When struck or spoken near, it sings softly with delayed, harmonic resonanceâ€”echoing not just sound, but sometimes **thought**, **feeling**, or **memory**. The [[Icebound]] use it in their forges, crypts, and rune-altars.

## Properties  
- Stores and reflects sounds or memories over time.
- Brittle when exposed to heat; thrives in cold and shadow.
- Glows faintly in the presence of unresolved emotion or ancestral spirits.

## Uses  
- Enchanted memory stones, gravemarkers, and spirit-lanterns.
- Rune-matrix insets in ceremonial Iceforged weapons.
- Forgesongs of [[Iceforging]] are often tuned using veins of Echo Quartz.
