**"It is neither of this world nor beyond it, but of the spaces between—the breath of the heavens turned to steel."**  
—Excerpt from _The Forgemaster’s Hymn_, carved within the Sanctuary of Iron

Aetherium is a **divine metal**, a substance both celestial and arcane in nature. It is said to be the crystallized essence of **[[Aelion]]’s light**, forged in the **crucible of creation itself**. Unlike mundane metals, Aetherium does not tarnish, rust, or degrade. It **glows with an inner radiance**, shifting in color from **pale blue to silver and deep violet**, like the auroras that dance across the sky.

Aetherium is **lighter than steel yet stronger than any earthly alloy**, capable of conducting magical energy **without loss or distortion**. It is prized by **runesmiths, enchanters, and artificers**, and its use was once a hallmark of **[[Solaran]] and [[Grundthain]] craftsmanship**.
