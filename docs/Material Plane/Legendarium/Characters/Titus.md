Titus, the imposing and majestic leader of the Tyrannosaurs in the jungle region of Canopy Heights, is a sight to behold. Towering over all other creatures in the area, he is a formidable Tyrannosaurus Rex with gleaming golden eyes that exude both intelligence and ferocity. His scales are a rich mix of deep green and earthy tones, camouflaging him effectively amidst the lush foliage of the jungle.

Titus carries himself with an air of regal authority, and his every movement is calculated and deliberate. He wears the scars of numerous battles, a testament to his prowess as a warrior and protector of the ancient ruins. A single prominent scar runs across one eye, a reminder of a close encounter with a formidable adversary.

As the leader of the Tyrannosaurs, Titus commands respect and loyalty from his subjects. He values strength and cunning, and only the most skilled and fierce dinosaurs earn the privilege to be part of his loyal retinue. Though deeply protective of the ancient ruins and the secrets they hold, Titus is also cautious and suspicious of outsiders, especially those who seek to disturb the sacred sanctum.

Despite his fearsome reputation, Titus possesses a keen intellect and a sense of honor. He is known to be just and fair in his rule, making decisions for the betterment of his clan. Yet, the shadow of mistrust for outsiders looms large, as he believes their intentions may be to exploit the sacred knowledge hidden within the ruins.

Titus' presence is a symbol of both strength and wisdom, and his role as guardian of the ancient ruins has made him a legend among the [[docs/Material Plane/Locations and Cities/Mokoweri/Mokoweri]] people. Those who have dared to cross paths with him know that, though fierce and imposing, he possesses a keen sense of judgment that cannot be taken lightly.
