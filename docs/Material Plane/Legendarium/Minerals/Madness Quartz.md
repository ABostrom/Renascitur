## Location  
Formed in the upper peaks around the [[Stormspire]], [[Madness Quartz]] is grown within storm-scarred geodes where thunder has split stone and rain has etched runes over centuries. It is often found in caverns where sound never dies and lightning echoes through the air like breath.

## Description  
[[Madness Quartz]] is a translucent, bluish crystal threaded with jagged inclusions that flicker with dormant energy. When held, it vibrates faintly in rhythm with nearby voices, and can emit a sharp chime when exposed to pressure shifts. It is said to remember the winds that shaped it. Only the [[Stormbound]] can safely tune its resonance through the ritual of [[Stormforging]].

## Properties  
- Stores and refracts sound and kinetic energy.
- Sparks or pulses when struck, sometimes causing sympathetic vibration in nearby quartz.
- Can be attuned to “resonate” across short distances with similarly forged items.

## Uses  
- Set into [[Skyforged Steel]] weapons and armor to allow silent communication during battle.
- Inlaid into pylons and storm beacons as passive signal conduits.
- Shards are sometimes embedded into the palms of Stormbound initiates, allowing them to “feel” the wind’s memory and detect shifting sky patterns.


## Lore
Storm Quartz is a gemstone that is normally a light blue in colour, but its appearance changes when it is charged by lightning.

When uncharged, Storm Quartz has a delicate, pale blue hue reminiscent of a clear summer sky. However, when it is struck by lightning, the gemstone's appearance transforms dramatically. The once-pale blue colour deepens and becomes more vibrant, taking on an electric blue hue that seems to pulse with energy.

The charged Storm Quartz is said to possess even greater power than the uncharged gemstone, as it has absorbed the energy of the lightning strike. It is believed that those who possess a charged Storm Quartz can harness this energy to manipulate the weather, summoning fierce storms and controlling the elements.

Due to its unique properties, Storm Quartz is highly prized by those who seek to control the weather or harness the power of the storm. However, finding a charged Storm Quartz is a rare and dangerous task, as it requires braving the elements and risking one's life in the pursuit of this powerful gemstone.

As such, Storm Quartz is both revered and feared, with many myths and legends surrounding its origins and powers. Whether one seeks to harness its power or simply admire its beauty, there is no denying the allure of this fascinating gemstone.
