## Location  
Forged high in the wind-scoured peaks surrounding the [[Stormspire]], [[Skyforged Steel]] is created from refined iron alloyed with trace amounts of [[Skyshatter Ore]] and tempered using lightning energy channeled through shards of [[Storm Quartz]]. Only the [[Stormbound]] possess the knowledge and precision to shape it through the volatile method known as [[Stormforging]].

## Description  
[[Skyforged Steel]] has a dull silver sheen that crackles faintly with residual charge. Forged not by flame but by arc-surges drawn through storm pylons, it carries the fury of the sky within. During crafting, the metal is suspended on runic lifts and flash-heated in bursts, forming a chaotic lattice that resonates with thunder. Its finish bears streaks of ozone-burn and polished lightning scars.

## Properties  
- Builds and stores ambient electrical energy passively.
- Highly resistant to lightning and mental influence.
- Emits a subtle ringing tone when weather shifts or storms approach.

## Uses  
- Forged into sky-hooks, lightning spears, and conductive armor worn by the storm sentinels of the [[Stormbound]].
- Used in crafting weapons that can arc between targets.
- Paired with [[Storm Quartz]], it enables linked weapons or armor to "resonate" across short distances â€” a silent call for aid or coordination.
