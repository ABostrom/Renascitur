## Location  
Harvested from the deep veins beneath [[The Wakened Trench]], where the pressure of the ocean and the proximity to the ancient wound of [[Leviathan]] has twisted the ore into something alien and half-living.

## Description  
[[Abyssal Iron]] is a dense, dark-blue metal laced with oily sheens and faint, pulsating veins. Though it is a form of iron, it resists conventional forging until it's exposed to brine-steam quenching and deep-pressure shaping. The [[Tidebound]] believe it was changed by the wound in the world, and that it carries a fragment of the trench’s hunger. It is considered both sacred and dangerous, rarely mined, and never discarded.

## Properties  
- Pulses faintly in the dark when submerged.
- Warps weak minds if handled without protection.
- Resistant to magical corrosion and mental intrusion.
- Slightly shifts shape over decades, as if "remembering" its form.

## Uses  
- Reinforced plating in deep-sea diving suits and hulls.
- Forged into ceremonial anchor-blades and soul-weights used in burial rites.
- Rarely made into weapons—those that are often whisper in dreams to their wielders.
