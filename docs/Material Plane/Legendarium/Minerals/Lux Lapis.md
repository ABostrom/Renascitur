Following the [[Psychic Schism]] light stone rained from the sky. As a result of the enormous amounts of death in the world, and the destruction of the pantheon of the gods. [[Machinery of Death]] was broken, the soul engine had stopped. [[Soul]] could not be reborn, and they could not be renewed and cleansed of their [[Luminis]]. As a result of this, they began to crystallise and manifest on the material plane. As the pure and good souls crystallised they formed the light stones and rained from the heavens. Those who were corrupt and persuaded by the offerings of [[Ishna]] formed something monstrous.
