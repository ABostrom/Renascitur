## Location  
Harvested from the trench-walls and deep reef caverns near [[the Wakened Trench]], [[Hungering Coral]] grows only in lightless places where the water churns and whispers. It is drawn toward vibration, sound, and blood. The [[Tidebound]] say it feeds on memory, not flesh.

## Description  
[[Hungering Coral]] resembles branching black coral laced with streaks of crimson or deep violet. It grows in curling spires, and it moves — slowly — even after being severed. It reacts to nearby movement with faint pulses or a tightening of its structure. The coral is carefully cultivated in abyssal gardens, trimmed under ritual silence, and dried in salt-laced sanctums before it can be safely used in [[Tideforging]].

## Properties  
- Reacts to sound and blood, “waking” slightly in the presence of violence or sorrow.
- Grows stronger in high-pressure, low-light environments.
- Can retain vibrations and patterns of speech, replaying them in dreams or song.

## Uses  
- Crushed and mixed into the brine quenching process for [[Salt Hardened Steel]], granting it subtle reactive traits.
- Carved into handles, hilts, or helm crests to echo commands or enhance abyssal rituals.
- Used in deep-sea tools or weapons designed to lure or disorient trench-born horrors.
