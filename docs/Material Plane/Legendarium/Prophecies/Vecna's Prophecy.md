[[Vecna]] wrote a single prophecy in the [[Book of Vile Darkness]] before he was destroyed. 

The prophecy was split into two parts sometime during [[The Age of Twilight's Lament]]. 

## Part 1
>There comes a day when impurity is born, two friends shall cause a vicious war.
 >When the time comes that fire burns blue, a promise shall mark broken friendships and an eternal night.
 >When the time comes that the last one is reborn, the accused shall cause a world of darkness.
 
## Part 2
> When the moment comes that the sky turns red, the outcast shall caused a rise in unrest
> The rising of a false king shall bring about ruin to the world.
> Those chosen of the twilight will have a choice to make, that will either bring great destruction or usher in an area of unnatural peace.
