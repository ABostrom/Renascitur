### **The Codex of Iron**

The **Codex of Iron** is a legendary artifact and sacred text created during the First Age, containing the teachings of **Muradin**, the god of Metal and Craftsmanship. It is a compendium of knowledge that encapsulates his philosophies, techniques, and the secrets of rune magic, offering guidance on how to harmonize innovation with discipline. The Codex is more than a written work—it is a symbol of resilience, ingenuity, and the divine inspiration Muradin imparted to his followers.

#### **Creation and Purpose**

The **Codex of Iron** was forged by [[Muradin]] and his most devoted followers during the height of [[Runehart]]’s glory. It was inscribed on indestructible sheets of [[Aetherium]] each rune-etched page imbued with divine energy, ensuring the teachings within could withstand the ravages of time. The codex served as a guiding light for those who embraced the path of Metal, offering knowledge to create weapons, tools, and structures capable of resisting the aberrant forces of [[Ishna]].

Muradin saw the codex not only as a repository of knowledge but as a blueprint for a better future. It taught his followers how to balance the raw power of innovation with the wisdom of restraint, ensuring their creations would serve the greater good rather than fall into destructive excess.

#### **Division and Legacy**

After the fall of **Runehart**, the **Codex of Iron** was divided into three parts to preserve its teachings:

1. **The First Fragment**: Taken by a sect of **Solarans** who studied under Muradin during the First Age. They safeguarded it in their archives, believing it essential to preserving the connection between their people and Muradin’s wisdom.
    
2. **The Second Fragment**: Kept by the survivors of Runehart’s final battle, passed down through dwarven generations. This fragment became a cultural and spiritual cornerstone, ensuring Muradin’s teachings remained central to dwarven society.
    
3. **The Third Fragment**: Lost during the siege of Runehart and believed to lie with the **Anvil of Eternity**, buried deep within the ruins of the hold. Its rediscovery is the subject of countless dwarven legends and a driving force for adventurers seeking to reclaim their lost heritage.

#### **Content of the Codex**

The **Codex of Iron** is said to include:

- **Runic Secrets**: Advanced techniques for crafting runes, enabling the creation of tools, weapons, and constructs of immense power.
- **Philosophies of Creation**: Muradin’s teachings on balancing innovation with responsibility, ensuring that invention serves life rather than destroys it.
- **Blueprints of the Divine Forge**: Schematics for building forges and machinery capable of harnessing elemental and divine energies.
- **Chronicles of Runehart**: Accounts of Runehart’s history, including the rise of Muradin, the teachings of Metal, and the battle against **Typhon**, the **Archon of Death**.

#### **Modern Significance**

The fragmented Codex remains a symbol of unity and hope for both dwarves and the **Ferrun**. Its pieces, scattered across the world, represent a bridge between Muradin’s followers and their shared legacy. The **Ferrun**, who revere Muradin in his original **Grundthain** form, guard their fragment as a sacred relic, while the dwarves preserve their fragment as a cornerstone of their culture.

The third, missing fragment is a source of mystery and legend. Many believe that reclaiming it—and reuniting the Codex—would unlock the full potential of Muradin’s teachings, allowing the creation of artifacts and machines that could rival those of the First Age.



### **The Song of the World’s Forging**

_Carved into the Iron Codex, passed down from the First Age_

---

**Before the first chisel struck the stone, before the first fire burned in the forge, there was nothing.**  
A silence vast and empty, stretching beyond all measure. No mountain stood, no river ran, no sky arched above. All was void, waiting for a hand mighty enough to shape it.

Then came [[Tharamos]], the Unyielding Stone, the first and greatest of the Makers.

He rose from the abyss with a hammer in his hand and an anvil at his feet, and with the first strike of his will, he **shattered the silence**. Sparks flew from his forge, and the first stones of the world took shape.

Where his hammer fell, **mountains rose**.  
Where his chisel carved, **valleys were made**.  

The bones of the world were laid, strong and enduring, unbroken by time or tide.

But the stone was cold, and the fire was still. The world had form, but not motion, and so **Tharamos called for his brother, [[Valtor]], the Endless Tide**.

---

### **The Waters and the Fire**

From the far edges of the world, where the sea had no shore, **[[Valtor]] answered**. He brought forth the first rain, carving great rivers through the mountains and filling the deep places with the song of the waves.

He cast the tides upon the earth, giving the world its rhythm, its motion, its breath.

Yet still, the world lay in darkness.

Then came **[[Aelion]], the Everburning Light**, who strode forth with flames upon his brow and fire in his hands. He kindled the sun-forges in the sky, setting them to burn for all time.

He melted the ice and turned stone to molten ore, filling the deep places with his fire. And thus, the great forges of the world were born, their embers burning with the first heat of creation.

---

### **The Verdant Soul**

Yet still, the world was barren. The stone was strong, the rivers swift, the fires hot—but nothing grew.

It was then that **[[Sylara]], the Verdant Soul**, stepped forth, hands weaving life into the world.

From the cracks in the stone, **roots took hold**, twisting through the mountains, binding the rivers, softening the earth.  
From the deep places, she called forth **beasts, birds, and creeping things**, and from the sky, she spun the breath of the wind.

Now the world had form. It had strength, it had motion, it had fire, and it had life. But still, there were none to shape it, none to guide it.

---

### **The Birth of the Keepers**

So **Tharamos took up his hammer once more**, and upon his anvil, he forged the **first of the Grundthain**.

From stone, he carved them, their backs broad and their hands strong, their hearts filled with the fire of the forge. **To them, he gave knowledge of the runes, so they might shape the world as he had.**

**Valtor cast the first of the humans** upon the shifting tides, giving them the gift of motion, change, and boundless potential.

**Aelion breathed light into the first Solarans**, making them brilliant and wise, attuned to the great forges of the heavens.

**Sylara wove the Kyojin from the threads of the world itself**, binding them to the soul of all living things, making them the keepers of the wild places.

Thus, the world was set in its order, and the Makers stepped back to watch their work unfold.

---

### **The Shattering and the Betrayer**

Yet the darkness had not been undone.

From the void beyond the forge, from the nothingness that hated the hammer’s song, came **[[Ishna]], the Unmaker**.

She was the hunger that devours, the silence that swallows, the rot that weakens. She crept into the hearts of the first mortals, whispering of things that **unravel instead of build, that shatter instead of forge**.

She **split stone**, turned rivers **to dust**, made fire **consume all it touched**. She was the **crack in the anvil, the flaw in the steel, the rust upon the forge**.

**Tharamos saw this and knew the world would not stand unless it was sealed.**

He raised his hammer one last time, and with a final, shattering blow, he **split the world from the void**, forging the great boundary that would keep Ishna at bay.

But the crack remained, hidden deep in the heart of the world.

And so he gave the [[Grundthain]] their purpose:

**To hold the line against the Unmaker.**  
**To guard the sacred runes and keep the foundation strong.**  
**To stand unyielding, as the world’s first Maker had.**

For the stone may crack, the fire may dim, the waters may wane, and the trees may wither—**but the forge endures.**

And so long as the hammer rings, the world shall stand.
