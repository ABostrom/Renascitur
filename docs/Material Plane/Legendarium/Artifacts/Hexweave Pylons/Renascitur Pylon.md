Location: [[The Ruins of Baldur's Gate]]
Status: Online 

Located under the city of modern day Baldur’s Gate. The [[House Silverhand]] family built their vault in the catacombs that led down to the Pylon. Recognising it as a place of great power, and security. But left it well alone.    

The way to the vault - requires a living descendant of [[Vecna]], or someone wielding one of the fragments of his soul.
