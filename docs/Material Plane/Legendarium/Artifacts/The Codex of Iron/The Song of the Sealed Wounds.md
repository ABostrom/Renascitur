The world cracked.

Not in fire or flood, but in silence.  
A slow shivering at the edge of the soul, as if the breath of the world caught and never exhaled.

And in that silence, the corruption crept.

The Elementals—Tharamos, Sylara, Aelion, and Valtor—began to wane.  
Their bodies, once vast and whole, now shuddered.  
Pieces broke away like rust from iron, flaking into the earth.

Muradin saw the threat.  
Not death—but transformation. Not a fall—but a distortion.  
The world could not survive the death of its makers, nor their consumption.

These fragments, corrupted but living, were too potent to destroy.  
They bore the essence of the Makers.  
But that essence had turned against the world.

So Muradin forged a path no other dared tread:  
**He would not kill. He would bind.**

### The Binding of the Fragments

To the south, beneath the waves, where the world thinned into black abyss—  
there pulsed a fragment of **Leviathan**, kin to Valtor, now bloated with hunger.  
Muradin journeyed to the trench and cast chains of rune-forged iron into the depths.  
He forged the **Wakened Trench**, sealing the tideborne madness beneath the sea.

To the north, beneath ice and frost, a shard of **Zaratan**, son of Tharamos, shuddered in agony.  
Twisted by stillness, frozen by fear, it turned its pulse inward to decay.  
Muradin carved a heart of frost around it, and placed it beneath a city of stillness.  
This was the **Pulsecore**, a wound made quiet by ice and discipline.

In the east, in the sky-haunted peaks, a sliver of **Tempus** howled in eternal storm.  
Lightning devoured stone, and thunder tore sky from sky.  
Muradin ascended, his beard turning to ash, and struck runes into the tallest spire.  
The storm was chained to the **Stormspire**, and the wind wept no more.

And in the west, deep in the molten heart of the world,  
the breath of **Phenos** burned without cease.  
The flame would not die, and so Muradin gave it sanctuary.  
He built the **Eternal Flame**, not as prison, but promise—  
for even corrupted fire may one day be tamed.

### The Price of the Seal

Each city he built above the wound.  
Not to guard—but to remember.  
Not to hide—but to carry the burden.

The dwarves would forget. But the stones would not.  
Their runes would remember.  
Their crafts would echo.

The seals were not vaults, but scars.  
Scars that bled into the bones of dwarvenkind.

Some would be blessed. Others broken.  
But all would bear the echo of the Wound.

And Muradin, now no longer merely smith,  
had become the World’s Binder.

The Forgefather.  
The Chainwright.  
The Silent Anvil.

So long as the runes are carved,  
and the flame is kindled—  
the seals will hold.

But the world waits in silence,  
for the hammer to fall again.
