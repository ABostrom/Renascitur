**Description**: The Blood Kriss is a dark and ominous weapon, a knife forged through an ancient and forbidden technique. It is said that the iron in a skilled smith's blood was extracted, refined, and then painstakingly crafted into this deadly blade. The kriss, with its distinctive wavy blade, emanates a sinister aura, its surface etched with faint, pulsing red lines reminiscent of veins.

**Appearance**:

- **Blade**: The blade of the Blood Kriss is a deep, metallic red, almost black in certain lights. It has a serpentine, wavy shape, traditional to kriss daggers, which symbolizes both its deadly nature and the flow of blood from which it was made. The edges are unnaturally sharp, capable of cutting through flesh and bone with ease.
- **Hilt**: The hilt is wrapped in a dark, leather-like material that seems to pulse faintly when held, as if the blade itself were alive. The pommel is adorned with a small, blood-red gem that glows faintly, possibly infused with the last drop of the smith's blood.
- **Overall Aura**: The entire knife gives off a subtle, malevolent aura. Those who hold it may feel a slight chill and a faint whispering in the back of their minds, as if the blade is eager to taste blood once more.

**Properties**:

- **Blood Bond**: The Blood Kriss has a unique bond with its wielder. Once attuned, the wielder can feel the knife’s presence even when it’s not in their possession. The blade responds to the wielder’s thoughts, becoming a deadly extension of their will in combat.
- **Lifedrain**: On a successful strike, the Blood Kriss can drain a small amount of vitality from the victim, healing its wielder by a fraction of the damage dealt. This lifedrain effect also temporarily enhances the wielder’s physical abilities, making them faster and stronger in battle.
- **Blood Memory**: The blade has a dark memory of all the lives it has taken. Once per day, the wielder can call upon the knowledge of a past victim, gaining insight or skills the victim once possessed for a short period.

**Curse**:

- **Bloodlust**: The Blood Kriss is a cursed weapon. Over time, the wielder may begin to crave violence, becoming increasingly aggressive and bloodthirsty. The blade whispers to its wielder in moments of weakness, urging them to spill blood. If not regularly satisfied, the curse may compel the wielder to harm those close to them, even against their will.

**Backstory**:

- **Creation**: The Blood Kriss was created by a master blacksmith who sought to create the ultimate weapon. Obsessed with the purity of iron in blood, he sacrificed his own life in the forging process, imbuing the blade with a piece of his soul. The kriss was said to have been used in countless dark rituals and assassinations throughout history.
- **Legacy**: The blade has passed through many hands, often leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Few can wield it without succumbing to its bloodthirsty curse. Those who do often become feared assassins or warriors of unparalleled skill, but at the cost of their humanity.
