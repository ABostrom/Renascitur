Nyxthorn is a rare, **petrified fungal wood** found deep within the **World Beneath**, where it grows in the remains of long-dead **Titan Mycelium**. Over centuries, the decayed fungal matter absorbs residual arcane energy from underground ley lines, crystallizing into a **black, ebony-like wood** with streaks of deep violet or faint silver veins.

#### **Growth & Ecology**:

- **Formation**: Nyxthorn begins as the decaying core of **Deepspore Trees** or massive fungal networks. Instead of rotting away, the wood undergoes a slow alchemical transformation, solidifying into a near-indestructible material.
- **Environment**: Found in **deep chasms**, **abandoned ruins**. It thrives in places where magic lingers, often absorbing **necrotic, shadow, or astral energy**.
- **Harvesting**: Extremely difficult to cut with normal tools. 
- **Mystical Properties**:
    - Naturally **resistant to fire, rot, and corrosion**.
    - Can **store and channel magical energy**, making it highly prized for crafting wands, staves, and armor.
    - Some believe it retains echoes of the ley lines it was formed near, making it valuable for **divination rituals**.

Nyxthorn is **a sacred material** among **[[Ferrun]]**, and certain underground cults, often used in relics, staff-carvings, and high-status armor.
