Elturel was once a prospering city along the river Chionthar. Before the [[Psychic Schism]] it was a centre of agriculture and commerce in the region. The city was situated atop a bluff with a cliff dominating the river. It was a good defensive position and a good crossing point.Â 

The city was decimated after the schism, as the forces of [[Ishna - The God Unborn]] used the city to stage an all out assault into [[Infernum]].
