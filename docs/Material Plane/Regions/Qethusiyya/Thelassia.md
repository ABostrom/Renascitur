# Thelassia: The City of the Endless Flame

Nestled deep beneath the Dead Desert, Thelassia is an industrious haven of innovation and survival. Carved into the subterranean rock, this small industrial city is built around its lifeblood: a massive coal-burning generator that provides the energy necessary to sustain the Metal Elves and their coal-punk civilization.

## City Layout

- **The Core**: At the heart of Thelassia stands the [[Coalforge Engine]] a gargantuan coal-burning generator that powers the city. Its constant thrum reverberates through every corner of Thelassia, with glowing conduits distributing energy to the workshops, homes, and factories surrounding it.
- **The Forge District**: The workshops and foundries of the Forge District are where Metal Elves craft their machinery and inventions. Steam hisses, and the clang of hammers on metal creates an ever-present symphony of industry.
- **The Crag-Tiers**: Housing is arranged in tiered layers spiraling outward from the Core. Each tier is connected by lifts and ladders, with the higher levels reserved for esteemed inventors and engineers.
- **The Chimney Spires**: Massive chimneys extend upward to the surface, venting smoke and heat from the Coalforge Engine. These spires also double as observation posts for any intrusions from above.
- **The Deep Mines**: Below the city, miners extract coal and rare minerals necessary to keep the Coalforge Engine running. The mines are treacherous and sometimes lead to strange and ancient ruins, remnants of Solaran civilization.


## Life in Thelassia

- **Survival Through Innovation**: Every citizen of Thelassia contributes to the city’s survival, whether by crafting, mining, or engineering. The Metal Elves are pragmatic and industrious, valuing ingenuity above all else.
- **A City of Shadows and Light**: The dim glow of the Coalforge Engine illuminates the city, casting long shadows across its metal walkways and mechanical structures. The atmosphere is one of constant activity, with steam and smoke filling the air.
- **Community by Necessity**: While the Metal Elves are independent by nature, their shared reliance on the Coalforge Engine fosters a sense of unity. Festivals are rare but revolve around the generator’s maintenance cycles.

## Structure of Society in Thelassia

The society in Thelassia is a tightly-knit, industrious community organized around the principles of innovation, survival, and resource management. Its structure reflects the Metal Elves’ coal-punk ethos, emphasizing meritocracy, technological progress, and the maintenance of their precarious underground existence.

## Cultural Values

- **Innovation as Survival**: The Metal Elves see technological progress as the key to their survival, fostering a culture of constant invention.
- **Community Over Individualism**: The society values collective effort, as every role contributes to the city’s survival.
- **Pragmatism**: Emotions and traditions take a backseat to practicality, and decisions are made based on logic and efficiency.

## Social Classes

### The Emberforged
The upper echelon, composed of inventors, scholars, and high-ranking engineers.
They live closest to the Coalforge Engine, benefiting from better light and access to technology.
Their focus is on innovation and governance.

### The Ashbound
The working class responsible for mining, machinery maintenance, and construction.They live in the lower tiers of the city, near the mines and foundries.Despite their status, they are highly respected for their essential contributions

### The Scorchmarked
Outcasts or those who fail to contribute to the society’s advancement. Often assigned the most dangerous or menial tasks, such as venturing into the mines to retrieve resources from hazardous areas.

### The Steamborn
