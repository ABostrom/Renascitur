The order of [[magnus]] was formerly recognised following the death of Magnus Hammerfell in 100 AS. During his life [[Magnus]] has founded his order of Clerics to spread the teachings of the Old God [[Moradin]]. Knowing that [[Moradin]] had saved his life, he felt it his holy duty to spread his teachings to all [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] of the new world.
