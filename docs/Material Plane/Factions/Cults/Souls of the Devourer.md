Symbol: שקש๔

The souls of the devourer are a cult dedicated to [[Ishna - The God Unborn]] and ensuring that the work started during the [[Psychic Schism]] is completed. The cult is secretly fronted by a working class revolution to upend the power and order of the [[Firebrand Empire]]. Disgruntled labourers and members of the [[VPVD]] are recruited to aid in the destabilisation of the empire, by strike action, sabotage, espionage and then once indoctrination has begun acts of violence.
