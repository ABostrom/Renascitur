## Overview

Beneath the glacial city of [[Uftine]] lies a place of ancient silence and terrible weight: **The Pulsecore**. Carved into the ice-veined bedrock of the mountain itself, it is both a vault and a warning—a chamber where the dwarves unknowingly keep vigil over the fractured soul of a god.

  

The Pulsecore is not open to the public. Its existence is known only to the [[Gromdir Stillhand|Icebound Thane]], the [[Fracturecast]], and the sworn [[Icebound Sentinels]]. Even among them, few have ever stood in its presence. Those who have report the sensation of a heartbeat in the stone.

## The Bound Fragment of Zaratan

Entombed within the Pulsecore is a corrupted progeny of [[Zaratan]], the Great Elemental of Stone. During the twilight of the First Age, this shard was cut from Zaratan’s essence by [[Muradin]] after it was twisted by [[Ishna]]’s influence.


- It is no longer a creature, but a mass of silent pressure and broken memory.
- The glacier itself formed around it, freezing the wound in time.
- Runes of containment and forgetting are carved into its surrounding chamber.

  
The dwarves believe the Pulsecore to be merely a relic—an old ritual space from before Uftine was founded. They do not know it still pulses, slow and deep, in rhythm with something older than stone.
## The Vault Structure

The Pulsecore is layered with concentric seals formed from both rune magic and glacial compression:
- **Outer Ring**: Patrolled by the [[Icebound Sentinels]]. Features echo chambers to detect vibration shifts.
- **Mid Ring**: Covered in Frost Runes of Stillness, meant to disrupt psionic bleed or aberrant thought patterns.
- **Inner Ring**: Sealed by the Thane himself during the Rite of Binding. Only re-opened for reinforcement in times of great tectonic disturbance.

Faint seismic activity across Uftine is not tectonic. It is the fragment’s breath.

## Symbolism

The Pulsecore is reflected in Uftine’s architecture and rituals:

- Spiral layouts mirror the vault’s seal rings.
- The dwarves' reverence for silence originates in its containment runes.
- Coldsmithing pressure systems are inspired by the vault’s geothermal diffusion mechanisms.

  
## Beliefs
Some among the deep lorekeepers believe the Pulsecore is part of a network. They speak of **four pulses** across the world—slow heartbeats echoing from beneath the dwarven cities.

The Icebound do not seek to awaken, destroy, or understand what lies beneath. They seek only to **endure**, for the sake of the world above.
