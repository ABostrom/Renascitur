Vaelis is meticulous, detail-oriented, and uncompromising when it comes to protocols. With perfectly pressed attire and an ever-present clipboard inscribed with [[Ferrun]] runes, she tracks every measurement and calculation down to the decimal. Vaelis believes in the sanctity of [[Muradin]]’s teachings and sees the partnership with the [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] as an opportunity to _restore proper order_ to their methods. Her rigid adherence to procedure often clashes with [[Bramli Ironvein|Bramli's]] reckless approach, but her designs are flawless, and her knowledge of Ferrun technology is unmatched. She’s respected, if not entirely beloved, for her precision and cool-headedness.
