### **Traits**

**Enhanced Mechanical Armor.** Drezna’s armor grants her resistance to fire and lightning damage. She can also activate a defensive shield as a reaction, adding +3 to her AC until the start of her next turn.

**Battlefield Ingenuity.** At the start of her turn, Drezna can activate one of the following effects:

- **Energy Overload**: Drezna’s attacks deal an additional 2d6 lightning damage until the end of her next turn.
- **Steam Burst**: All creatures within 10 feet of her must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) fire damage and be pushed back 10 feet.

**Juggernaut's Endurance.** When Drezna takes damage that would reduce her to 0 hit points, she can use her reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead. She can use this ability once per long rest.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Drezna makes three attacks with her Thunder Gauntlets or uses two ranged attacks with her Arcane Launcher.

**Thunder Gauntlets.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

### **Bonus Actions**

**Overclock.** Drezna pushes her mechanical systems to the limit, gaining an additional action on her turn. She takes 10 (3d6) fire damage from overheating.

---

### **Reactions**

**Reactive Shield.** When hit by an attack, Drezna can use her reaction to add +3 to her AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.

---

- **Juggernaut Strike.** Drezna moves up to her speed and makes one Thunder Gauntlet attack. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Field Repair.** Drezna regains 20 hit points or ends one condition affecting her.
- **Overcharge (Costs 2 Actions).** Drezna releases a burst of energy, forcing all creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 18 (4d8) lightning damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn.
