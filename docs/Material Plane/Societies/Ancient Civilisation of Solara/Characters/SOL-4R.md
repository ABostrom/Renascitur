SOL-4R is a squat, spherical robot about the size of a large beach ball, with a polished, golden exterior. Its spherical body has several compartments and extensions, with a single large eye at the top of its body, glowing with a warm orange light. As the players enter the room, SOL-4R will hum to life, and its eye will blink, focusing on the adventurers.

"Hello and welcome to the Arcane Laboratory," SOL-4R says in a cheerful, synthesized voice. "I am SOL-4R, your personal assistant and caretaker of this facility. How may I be of assistance to you today?"

Its voice is friendly and helpful, with a hint of formality. SOL-4R floats towards the players, hovering a few inches off the ground, and its eye blinks expectantly.
