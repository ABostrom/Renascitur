Deep within the lush jungles of Mokoweri lies a lost city, hidden from the rest of the world. The city is said to be ancient, dating back to the time when the Mokoweri and the Saurians lived in harmony in a technological utopia. The city is shrouded in mystery, with tales of strange lights and sounds emanating from within.

The city itself is a marvel of advanced technology, powered by a rare and powerful gemstone known as Sun Topaz. The buildings are made of a strange, metallic material that seems to shift and change in the light, and are covered in intricate patterns and symbols. The streets are lined with strange devices and machinery, some of which still hum with a faint energy.

Despite the advanced technology, the city is also home to lush greenery and sparkling streams. Gardens and parks are interspersed throughout the city, their beauty enhanced by the strange energy of the Sun Topaz. The people who once lived in the city were said to be masters of technology, able to manipulate the forces of nature itself with their inventions.

Today, the lost city is mostly empty, its inhabitants long gone. But some brave adventurers still venture into the jungle, seeking to unlock the secrets of the city and harness the power of the Sun Topaz. Some say that the city holds the key to unlocking a new age of technological advancement, while others warn of the dangers of meddling with forces beyond our understanding.

Some [[Solartificers]] also specialize in the creation of golems and other constructs, imbuing them with the power of the sun to make them even more powerful and durable.
