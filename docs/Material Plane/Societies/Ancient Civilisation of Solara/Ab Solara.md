Deep in the heart of the city is an ancient stargate, which leads to an interstellar observatory. The stargate is powered by a combination of Sun Topaz and an ancient technology that is not fully understood. It is said that the stargate can transport travellers across vast distances, to other worlds and galaxies. The observatory beyond the stargate is filled with strange instruments and devices, which allow the scholars of Solara to study the cosmos in ways that are impossible for the rest of the world. It is said that the knowledge contained within the observatory could unlock the secrets of the universe, but the dangers of the journey and the unknown nature of the technology have kept most explorers away.

#### Planar Connections

- [[Elementis Ignis]]: Ab Solara's connection to the Plane of Fire leads to a realm of searing heat and towering flames, where rivers of lava flow and volcanoes constantly erupt. The air is thick with smoke and ash, and fire elementals roam freely, seeking to stoke the flames of destruction.
    
- [[Elementis Aqua]]: Ab Solara's connection to the Plane of Water leads to a vast oceanic realm, where endless waves crash against each other and titanic whirlpools spin relentlessly. Strange creatures, both gentle and dangerous, swim through the waters, and ancient ruins lie hidden in the depths, waiting to be discovered by daring adventurers.
