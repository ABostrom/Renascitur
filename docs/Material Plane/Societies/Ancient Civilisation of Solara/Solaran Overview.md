**Overview**: The Solarans, an ancient and advanced civilization, were known for their profound connection to celestial energies and their mastery of both arcane magic and advanced technology. The Solarans possessed an innate ability to harness the power of the sun. This natural affinity defined their culture, technology, and spiritual practices. Though their civilization has long since fallen, their legacy continues to influence the world of Renascitur.

**Origins and Expansion**: The Solarans trace their origins to the stars, considering themselves born among the celestial bodies. Their early history on Renascitur is marked by rapid expansion and the construction of remarkable structures known as the **Ab Solara** (Stargates). These stargates enabled them to connect with distant parts of the cosmos and establish a vast, interconnected empire. Their capital city, **Solara**, became a beacon of knowledge, culture, and technological innovation.

**Society and Culture**: Solaran society was structured around a reverence for knowledge, wisdom, and the pursuit of cosmic balance. They believed that every individual possessed a small sun within them, a source of life and purpose. This belief permeated their culture, influencing their art, music, poetry, and communal practices.

**Solartificers**: At the heart of Solaran technological advancement were the [[Solartificers]]. These engineers and creators were responsible for crafting a wide array of arcane machinery, from golems and automations to vehicles capable of land, sea, air, and space travel. They also designed and maintained the stargates, blending solar power with intricate magical runes to fuel their creations.

**Sun Speakers**: Serving as the spiritual and religious leaders of the Solarans, the Sun Speakers guided their people in matters of faith, morality, and ethics. Considered divine intermediaries, their souls were believed to be capable of reincarnation. [[Ketharion]], the last known Sun Speaker, is a revered figure in Solaran history. Sun Speakers led elaborate rituals and ceremonies that honored the sun and the cosmos, seeking to maintain the delicate balance of existence.

**Technological and Magical Advancements**: The Solarans excelled in developing technologies that seamlessly integrated magic and advanced engineering. They created the [[LifeThread Matrix]], a conceptual framework that embodied the interconnectedness of spiritual, genetic, and ancestral dimensions. This sacred tapestry was central to their understanding of life and death.

[[Sun Topaz]]: A critical resource for the Solarans was sun topaz, a light gold gemstone capable of absorbing and storing solar energy. Mined primarily in Cascadia, these gemstones powered the arcane machinery and technological devices that defined Solaran civilization. Exposing sun topaz to direct sunlight charged its crystalline structure, making it a versatile and renewable energy source.

**The Endless Sun**: In their quest to ensure universal balance, the Solarans created the [[The Endless Sun]] a colossal machine orbiting the sun as an artificial moon. Its purpose was to maintain the natural cycle of birth, life, and death by sustaining the finite number of souls in existence. However, the Endless Sun ultimately fell to corruption due to the malevolent influence of Ishna and the betrayal of Hyperion, a prominent Solaran leader.

**Downfall and Corruption**: Ishna's influence twisted the energies of the Endless Sun, transforming it into a source of aberrant power. [[Hyperion]], played a crucial role in this corruption. Aligning with Ishna, he manipulated the core energy systems of the Endless Sun, allowing [[Ishna]] to infuse it with his dark power. This betrayal led to the collapse of Solaran civilization, initiating Ishna's conquest across the stars and resulting in the catastrophic [[The Forge Wars]].

**Splinter Groups**: Following the fall of their civilization, the surviving Solarans fragmented into various splinter groups, each adapting to new environments and circumstances:

- [[Elves#Mokoweri Mokoweri Elves]] Retreated to the deep forests, embracing nature and rejecting technology.
- [[Elves#Deep Elves]]: Moved underground, adapting to life in darkness and shunning the sun.
- [[Elves#Thaysian Elves]]: Focused exclusively on arcane mastery, abandoning both natural and technological pursuits.

**Bio-Engineering and the Saurians**: In a final effort to combat Ishna's corruption, the Solarans bio-engineered a race resistant to his influence. The [[Saurian]] were created as a resilient species, embodying the Solarans' last legacy. However, some experiments resulted in mutated offspring, which escaped and evolved into the monstrous [[Slaad]].

**Stargates (Ab Solara)**: These [[Ab Solara]] enabled the Solarans to connect distant parts of the cosmos, facilitating their expansive influence and interstellar travel.


## **The Pillars of Solaran Culture**

The Solarans, ancient beings who once thrived among the stars, built their civilization upon the **Three Pillars**: **Arcane**, **Science**, and **Nature**. These pillars were more than ideologiesâ€”they were the foundation of their society, shaping their art, governance, and technology. The Arcane was a wellspring of magical prowess, blending mystical energy with celestial wisdom. Science drove innovation, enabling spacefaring vessels, genetic engineering, and the creation of wonders like the Endless Sun. Nature anchored their spiritual and ecological harmony, emphasizing balance and nurturing life across worlds. When the Endless Sun fell and the Solarans splintered, these pillars became the defining aspects of the elven factions that rose from their legacy.
