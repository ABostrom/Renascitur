The Arcane Observatory, located in geostationary orbit above the material plane, is a colossal structure that was once the pinnacle of Solaran magical and technological research and exploration. It was built by the most brilliant minds of the ancient world, who sought to understand the mysteries of magic, technology and the universe.

Now, however, the Observatory is dormant and deserted. Its chambers and laboratories stand empty, and its libraries and archives have been left to gather dust. The once-great Solari who worked here have long since passed away or moved on to other pursuits.

[[Ab Solara]]'s connection to the Arcane Observatory is a tenuous one, as the Observatory is no longer active. Nevertheless, it remains a vital link to the ancient and powerful magic that once flowed through the material plane. Those who are able to access the Observatory can still learn much about the workings of magic and the cosmos, and perhaps even discover forgotten secrets and treasures hidden away in its depths.
