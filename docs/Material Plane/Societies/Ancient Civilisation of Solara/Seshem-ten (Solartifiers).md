Solartifiers are skilled craftsmen and artisans who specialise in creating magical items and artefacts powered by the energy of the sun. They possess a deep understanding of the workings of magic and the energy of the sun, and are able to combine these two elements in order to create powerful and unique objects.

Solartificers are highly respected in Solara society for their ability to harness the power of the sun and channel it into their creations. They are often sought out by those in need of powerful magical items or weapons, and their services are highly prized.

Solartificers typically work in well-lit areas, often outdoors or in rooms filled with natural light. They are skilled at manipulating light and solar energy to create powerful enchantments and imbue their creations with magical properties.
