## Overview  
The [[Windscribes]] are a sacred order among the [[Stormbound]] dwarves of [[Thundrakar]] — keepers of resonance, loreweavers of thunder, and chroniclers of stormsong.

They believe that every storm carries memory, and that the voice of [[Tempus]] still echoes through the lightning drawn to the [[Stormspire]]. Their duty is not to master the storm, but to **listen to it** — and **record what it remembers**.

## Role in Stormbound Society  
The Windscribes are revered not as warriors, but as interpreters. Where the hammer strikes steel, the Windscribe strikes **truth from thunder**.

They are trained from youth to detect subtle shifts in resonance — from the pitch of wind passing through cavern tunnels to the harmonic distortion of a storm brewing days away.

Most rites and decisions of state in [[Thundrakar]] are undertaken only after the Windscribes have “read the sky.” Even the [[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer]] was once a Windscribe, and is still considered part of their order.

## Duties and Rites  
- **Storm Chanting**: Ritual hums and tones performed to harmonize with incoming storms.
- **Echo Reading**: Deciphering faint resonant patterns in [[Storm Quartz]] to uncover messages or omens.
- **Lightning Transcription**: Recording the shapes and sounds of strikes during rites, believed to be the closest thing to spoken words of [[Tempus]].
- **Pylon Tuning**: Adjusting the great pylons around the [[Stormspire]] to prevent disruptive resonance buildup.

## Garb and Tools  
Windscribes wear cloaks sewn from **storm-felt**, a specially treated fabric that responds to pressure changes. Their tools include **resonance forks**, **aetherquills**, and **stormglass recorders**.

Many carry **storm journals**, encoded with runes only audible when held during a thunderclap.

## Beliefs  
The Windscribes believe that the storm **does not forget**. Every lightning strike is a word. Every echo is a name. They consider their work a sacred responsibility to ensure that nothing Tempus remembers is ever lost.
