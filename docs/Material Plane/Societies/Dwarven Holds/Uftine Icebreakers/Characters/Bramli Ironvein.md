Bramli is a bold, unconventional engineer known for pushing the boundaries of traditional dwarven craftsmanship. With a wild beard streaked with soot and eyes that gleam with mischief, he’s notorious for risky shortcuts and daring excavation methods. Bramli's innovative tunneling techniques—like rune-infused blasting charges and unstable steam drills—have sped up projects, but not without their share of _explosive_ incidents. Despite his rebellious streak, he commands fierce loyalty from his crew, who respect his fearless leadership and knack for getting the job done, even if it means bending a few rules.
