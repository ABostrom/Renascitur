"The Solarans were guardians of wisdom and keepers of balance. They valued harmony between the natural world and the power they harnessed. Can you truly embody these ideals?"

Titus regards them silently for a moment before nodding, his expression softened. "You have shown potential," he admits. "But the path to earning our trust is long and arduous. The trials you face will not be easy, but they will test your commitment to the Solaran ways."

He steps back, giving them a nod of approval. "Prove yourselves in the trials, and perhaps you will earn the right to be considered allies of the Tyrannosaurs and guardians of the ancient ruins."

With that, he turns and leads them deeper into the jungle, where the trials await. The players walk with determination, knowing that they carry the weight of their words and actions in the sacred lands of Mokoweri. They understand that the road ahead will challenge not only their magical prowess but also their hearts and souls, as they seek to prove themselves worthy of the Solaran legacy.


## Trial of Courage
The Trial of Courage is a test of bravery and valor. To face this trial, one must enter the treacherous Embered Caverns, a dark, winding labyrinth deep within the heart of the jungle. These ancient caves are filled with mysterious dangers, including venomous creatures and bottomless chasms. The candidates must navigate the winding tunnels, conquer their fears, and emerge unscathed to prove their courage to the Tyrannosaurs.

**1. The Entrance:** The journey begins as the players enter the dark and winding Embered Caverns. The dimly lit passageways are suffused with an eerie red glow emanating from the walls, creating a mysterious atmosphere.

**2. Challenges and Dangers:** As they venture deeper into the caverns, the players face a series of trials that test their courage. They might encounter venomous creatures, navigate narrow ledges over abyssal pits, or outsmart traps set by nature itself.

**3. The Ruby Chamber:** After overcoming a multitude of challenges, the players eventually arrive at the heart of the caverns, where the Ruby Sunstone is rumored to be held. The chamber is a vast, mystical space bathed in a deep red radiance.

**4. Guardian or Puzzle:** To obtain the Ruby Sunstone, the players must confront a guardian creature or solve a complex puzzle. The guardian could be an elemental entity connected to the gem's magic, or the puzzle may involve unlocking a hidden compartment within the chamber.

**5. Retrieving the Ruby Sunstone:** With their wits, courage, and problem-solving skills, the players secure the Ruby Sunstone. As they grasp the gem, they feel a surge of warmth and courage, as if the stone itself is acknowledging their valor.

**6. The Return:** Carrying the Ruby Sunstone, the players make their way back through the Embered Caverns, facing the same dangers in reverse. Their return is a triumphant moment, and they emerge from the dark labyrinth, now illuminated by the radiant glow of the Ruby Sunstone.



## Trial of Intellect
The Trial of Intellect assesses one's problem-solving skills and resourcefulness. In the Enigmatic Gardens, a place of lush vegetation and cunningly hidden traps, candidates must decipher complex riddles, solve intricate puzzles, and unlock hidden pathways. Each step brings them closer to the center of the gardens, where a great test of intellect awaits, and the wise use of knowledge is paramount to succeed.

## Trial of Wisdom
The Trial of Wisdom focuses on understanding and the capacity to learn from the past. In the Ancient Grove, candidates encounter ancient, wise creatures who guard the secrets of Mokoweri's history. To pass this trial, they must learn from these wise beings, understand the intricacies of the jungle, and show respect for the ancient knowledge of the Tyrannosaurs.
