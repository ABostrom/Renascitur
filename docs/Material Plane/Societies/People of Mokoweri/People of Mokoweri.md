The [[Mokoweri]] people are an ancient civilization with a rich and complex history. According to legend, their ancestors were among the first to inhabit the islands that now make up their homeland. They lived in harmony with the native [[Saurian]], developing a symbiotic relationship that would endure for centuries.

As time went on, the [[Mokoweri]] people grew and flourished, creating their own unique culture and society. They developed a deep connection with the natural world, learning to harness the power of the jungle to meet their needs. They also became skilled navigators, building seaworthy vessels that allowed them to explore the surrounding seas and trade with other civilizations.

Today, the Mokoweri people are known for their strong connection to the natural world and their emphasis on community and cooperation. They live in tight-knit villages and towns, with each person contributing to the collective wellbeing of the group.

The Mokoweri are skilled artisans and craftspeople, creating beautiful works of art and practical tools from the materials found in the jungle. They are also expert farmers and fishermen, providing ample food for their people and for trade with outsiders.

In terms of religion, the Mokoweri worship a pantheon of nature deities, including gods and goddesses associated with the sun, the sea, the sky, and the earth. They believe that all living things are connected and that the health of the natural world is essential to their own survival.

# Saurids

Mokoweri Saurids are a unique subset of druids who have a deep connection with the ancient and primal power of the dinosaurs that roam their lands. They have honed their skills in the art of wild shaping specifically to take on the form of these mighty beasts, mastering the physical abilities and instincts that come with them.

Saurids are deeply in tune with the natural world and have a great reverence for the balance of life. They see themselves as protectors of their homeland and work tirelessly to maintain the delicate equilibrium between the creatures of the land and the forces that threaten it.

In battle, Saurids can be incredibly formidable opponents, able to shift into the form of a dinosaur with lightning-fast speed and surprising strength. They are masters of ambush tactics and often use the terrain to their advantage, attacking from unexpected angles and quickly retreating to regroup.

Outside of battle, Saurids are respected members of Mokoweri society, often serving as spiritual leaders and advisors to their people. They are deeply respected for their wisdom and insight, and are seen as living embodiments of the power and majesty of the dinosaurs that once roamed their lands.
