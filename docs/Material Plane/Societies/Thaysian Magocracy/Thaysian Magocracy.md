### The Majlis of Arcane Sovereignty

At the helm of Eltabarr's governance are three grand sorcerers, each hailing from the city's dominant races: the Elves, Tieflings, and Humans. [[Aelar Amakiir]], the Verdant Sage, brings the wisdom of the Elves and their deep connection to nature. Zariel Mephistar, known as the Infernal Diplomat, embodies the resilience and ambition of the Tieflings. Farid al-Hakim, the Arcane Architect, represents the ingenuity and adaptability of Humans. Together, they guide Eltabarr through the currents of time, ensuring its prosperity and safeguarding its mystical secrets.
