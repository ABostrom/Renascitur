## Overview
A sun-blasted southern wasteland connected only by a narrow land bridge. It holds no known value, but whispers speak of ruins beneath the ash, and strange lights beyond the mountains.

## Major Cities
- *None officially recorded*

## Notes
Largely ungoverned. No official Imperator is assigned, but expeditions are sometimes sent to chart or monitor changes in the Reach.
