The silverhands are a pre-[[Psychic Schism]] family of great renown. Although much knowledge and history was either lost or destroyed from that era, their help to rebuild the empire, and shape its economy led to the rebuilding of civilization (in their favour of course). They are often at the forefront of trade negotiations with other civilisations, and are keen to re-establish trade routes. They’re particularly keen to expand the trade routes with the dwarven strongholds via the [[Deep Road]]s.
