### Elder Vellara

**Appearance:** Elder Vellara's scales are an ancient ivory, etched with lines of age and experience. Her eyes, a piercing shade of amber, seem to hold centuries of knowledge. Her robe is a tapestry of history, embroidered with scenes from Solaran lore, signifying her role as the keeper of knowledge.

**Greeting:** Vellara nods to each player, her expression inscrutable. "We are the sum of our ancestors' hopes and fears," she intones solemnly. "Through you, we glimpse the future they envisioned. Speak, and let us hear the echoes of their wisdom in your words."



## Corruption
- **Corruption Manifestation**:  
    As Lord Syuul's corruption spreads, Vellara’s curiosity warps into obsession. Her intellectual pursuits begin to twist, and she seeks not just knowledge but total domination over it. This leads to increasingly invasive and unethical methods of gathering information, especially regarding the ancient secrets of the Solarans. At the same time, her charm and wit turn into dangerous tools of seduction and manipulation. She grows fascinated with Arthur, seeing him not as an ally but as an object of desire and control.
    
- **Erratic Behavior**:  
    Vellara’s inquiries grow darker, and her once respectful pursuit of knowledge devolves into invasive questioning, manipulation, and dangerous experiments on the people of the island. Her charm turns predatory—she uses her allure to bend others to her will, with little regard for their autonomy. She becomes more reckless in her experimentation with ancient technology and magic, risking catastrophic consequences to satisfy her hunger for knowledge and power.
    
    Her obsession with Arthur takes on a disturbing tone, as she sees him as both a key to unlocking hidden knowledge and a prize to be won. She may become jealous or possessive, creating tension among the group. Her appearance also changes—her once subtle elegance becomes more extravagant, her attire and behavior designed to mesmerize and dominate those around her.
