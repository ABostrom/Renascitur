The Saurians are a reptilian humanoid species that inhabit the jungles and swamps of the Isle of [[Mokoweri]]. Long ago, they were part of a highly intelligent and technologically advanced civilization with a deep respect for nature and the natural world, now they live much simpler naturalistic lives

Physically, they are tall, muscular creatures with scaly skin, long tails, and sharp claws. They have a range of skin colours, including green, brown, and grey, and some individuals have bright markings or patterns on their scales.

The Saurians have a complex society with a strong emphasis on family and community. They live in large, communal dwellings and work together to gather food and resources, build structures, and advance their technology.

The Saurians have a deep spiritual connection to the natural world, and their religious practices reflect this. They worship a pantheon of deities that represent various aspects of nature, and their rituals often involve offerings to these gods and spirits.
