## Overview  
The [[Stormbound|Stormbound Dwarves]] are a proud and austere branch of dwarvenkind who dwell in [[Thundrakar]], the lightning-wreathed city carved into the heights and depths of the [[Stormspire]]. They are shaped — body and soul — by the unceasing storm that roars above and the sacred burden they carry: the **custodianship of the sealed fragment of [[Tempus]]**, the elemental god of storm and sky.

They are not merely miners or smiths.  
They are **translators of thunder**, **scribes of lightning**, and **guardians of resonance**.

## Ancestry and Legacy  
Descended from the ancient [[Grundthain]], the Stormbound are one of the four major dwarven clans — alongside the [[Tidebound]], [[Icebound]], and [[Flamebound]] — each of whom guards a piece of the broken world.

Their elemental burden, sealed by [[Muradin]] in the First Age, has shaped their traditions, their craft, and their spirits. They alone dwell in the storm’s shadow — and **thrive within it**.

## Society and Culture  
Stormbound culture reveres harmony, resonance, and memory. Their great rituals are not shouted — they are **sung in tuning tones** that ripple through stone and sky. Their forges ring not just with hammer and anvil, but with the voice of the storm itself.

Their leader is the [[High Conductor Aundril Voxhammer]], chosen not by blood, but by **resonant attunement** to the sealed fragment of [[Tempus]].

The [[Windscribes]], mystics and archivists of thunder’s voice, serve as lorekeepers and advisors, tuning the city’s pylons and deciphering the sky’s warnings.

## Physical Traits  
- Pale stone-toned skin, often with subtle crackling veins of glowing silver or blue.
- Hair tends to stand with static charge, even when still.
- Many carry small resonance talismans made of [[Storm Quartz]] that softly hum or ring in stormy air.

## Elemental Materials  
The Stormbound specialize in [[Stormforging]] — an elemental smithing tradition powered by lightning drawn directly from the heavens. Their materials include:

- [[Skyforged Steel]]
- [[Storm Quartz]]
- [[Skyshatter Ore]]

## Beliefs  
The Stormbound believe the storm **remembers what the world forgets**. Their sacred task is not to bind the sky — but to listen to it. They believe each lightning strike carries a fragment of memory, and it is their duty to ensure it is never lost again.
