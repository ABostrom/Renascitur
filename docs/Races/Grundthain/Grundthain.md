### The Grundthain of the First Age

The **Grundthain**, towering beings of elemental power and harmony, stood as the stewards of creation in the First Age. They were intrinsically bound to the elements of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air, their society flourishing in balance and unity. However, the shadow of [[Ishna]], the God Unborn, loomed over the world, threatening to unravel the natural cycles of life and death.

Muradin, a visionary among the Grundthain, foresaw the devastation [[Ishna]] would bring. He called upon the elemental clans to unite against this existential threat. However, the elemental Grundthain, deeply rooted in their devotion to the four great elementals—[[Leviathan]], [[Phenos]], [[Tempus]], and [[Zaratan]]—refused to abandon their ancient ways to combat this unprecedented danger. They believed their elemental harmony was eternal and unassailable.

### The Split and the Birth of Metal

Unable to sway his brethren, [[Muradin]] and his followers chose a new path. Rejecting the rigid traditions of the elemental clans, they sought the untapped potential of **Metal**, a fifth element born from the crucible of the earth. Metal represented strength, adaptability, and innovation—a force to craft weapons, fortresses, and machines capable of withstanding Ishna's corruption.

Muradin’s departure marked the first great schism in Grundthain society. His followers forged a new identity, casting aside their elemental ties to embrace the art of metalworking and rune-smithing. This transition altered their very beings over time, reshaping them into the shorter, sturdier forms that would later be recognized as the first dwarves.

### The Elemental Clans and Their Struggles

The remaining Grundthain clans, loyal to their elemental patrons, viewed Muradin’s path with disdain, considering it a betrayal of their ancestral heritage. They entrenched themselves deeper into their elemental worship, forming the great clans of giants:

- **Frost and Sea**: Loyal to **Leviathan**, the Frost Giants built icy fortresses along frozen coasts, channeling the primal power of water and cold.
- **Fire and Mountain**: Revering **Phenos**, the Fire Giants constructed vast forges within volcanic mountains, wielding the destructive and creative force of fire.
- **Cloud and Storm**: Devoted to **Tempus**, the Storm Giants raised skyborne citadels, commanding the winds and lightning from their lofty domains.
- **Stone and Hill**: Under **Zaratan**, the Hill Giants dwelled in the vast plains and rolling hills, embodying the enduring strength of the earth.

Though they sought to protect their sacred elemental nexuses, the clans struggled to maintain unity in the face of Ishna’s growing influence. Some giants, seduced by Ishna’s power, fell into corruption, becoming twisted aberrations of their former selves.

### Legacy of Muradin and the Dwarves

Muradin and his followers, though severed from the elemental Grundthain, created a legacy of resilience and innovation. Their mastery of **Metal** gave rise to unbreakable fortresses, intricate rune-forged weapons, and machines capable of combating the aberrant horrors unleashed by Ishna. Over the ages, their descendants—now known as dwarves—would become stalwart defenders against the forces of corruption.

Meanwhile, the elemental clans persisted in their worship of the great elementals, guarding the world’s natural balance even as their numbers dwindled. The division between the dwarves and giants became a defining moment in the history of the First Age, a rift born of necessity and conviction, shaping the destinies of both lineages.
