# Tidebound Dwarves

## Overview  
The [[Tidebound|Tidebound Dwarves]] are the seafaring clan of dwarvenkind who dwell in the fortified island-city of [[Draumhavn]], nestled between the continents of [[Pyrosia]] and [[Qethusiyya]]. Hardened by salt, storm, and deepwater dread, they are guardians of the **Wakened Trench** — the bound wound of [[Leviathan]] sealed by [[Muradin]] in the First Age.

To the Tidebound, the sea is not a mystery — it is a memory.  
They do not fear its hunger. They endure it.

## Ancestry and Legacy  
Born of the same ancient [[Grundthain]] stock as the other dwarven clans, the Tidebound were the first to turn from the mountain and toward the ocean. Following Muradin’s path, they settled on the edge of the world to watch over what should never rise again.

It is said the **sea beneath Draumhavn remembers the First Age**, and that when the tide sings, the drowned voices of ancient horrors sing with it.

## Society and Culture  
The Tidebound are pragmatic, ritualistic, and unyielding. They do not follow gods — they follow the **Creed**, an inherited code forged from necessity, silence, and survival. Their culture is oral, bound in oaths and salt-etched bone charms, rather than parchment.

Their leader is known as the **Harbormaster of the Deepwatch**, a singular voice of command whose authority is absolute during times of surge or silence. The name of the current Harbormaster is whispered in Draumhavn’s halls and carved only into ship keels and gravestones.

## Physical Traits  
- Skin weathered by salt and sun, often rough like driftstone.  
- Salt-threaded hair, often braided with coral, rusted rings, or shark teeth.  
- Some are “brine-marked,” touched by long proximity to the seal — their veins subtly shimmer, or their breath smells faintly of brine.

## Elemental Materials  
The Tidebound practice [[Tideforging]], crafting with materials born of ocean pressure and abyssal corruption. Their hallmarks include:

- [[Salt-Hardened Steel]]  
- [[Abyssal Iron]]  
- [[Hungering Coral]]

These are forged not in flame, but in furnaces that mimic the crushing, freezing depths of the sea. Their steel hums with pressure and remembers the ocean's weight.

## Beliefs  
The Creed teaches that survival is sacred, and watchfulness is holy. The sea cannot be mastered — only outlasted. The [[Wakened Trench]] is not sealed. It is sleeping. And the Tidebound must keep it that way.

They believe that to let the sea forget its chains is to doom the world to hunger again.
