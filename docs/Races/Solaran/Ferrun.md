# Ferrun

The [[Ferrun]] are descendants of the ancient Solarans who rejected the arcane and natural paths of their kin to embrace a life of innovation and craftsmanship. After the fall of **Solara**, they retreated deep underground, founding the industrial city of **Thelassia**. Here, they mastered metallurgy, rune magic, and engineering, forging a society dedicated to creation and purpose.

The Ferrun revere **Muradin**, the god of Metal and Craftsmanship, honoring him in his original **Grundthain** form, reflecting their respect for his ancient teachings. They believe in disciplined innovation, viewing the misuse of Muradin’s knowledge alongside unchecked arcane power as the cause of Solara’s downfall.

In recent years, the Ferrun have rekindled ties with their dwarven kin through the construction of an underground railroad, bridging their subterranean city to the great dwarven holds. This alliance represents a shared legacy of resilience, ingenuity, and devotion to Muradin’s enduring vision.

## The Ferrun of [[Thelassia]]

Hidden beneath the sands of the Dead Desert lies the city of **Thelassia**, a sprawling network of workshops, foundries, and mechanical marvels kept alive by the ingenuity of the **Metal Elves**. These descendants of the Solarans rejected the spiritual and arcane paths, instead embracing Science as their pillar of progress. Their city thrums with the sound of gears, the hiss of steam, and the glow of molten metal as they tirelessly refine their craft.
