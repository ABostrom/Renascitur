# Imperial Orc
Imperial orcs are a fierce and powerful race of the [[Firebrand Empire]]. 

Imperial orcs have rough, greyish-green skin, with prominent facial features that include a broad nose, jutting brow, and large, sharp teeth. They typically wear armour made from the hides of beasts they hunt, as well as metal plates and spikes to increase their intimidation factor in battle.

Imperial orcs are known for their love of battle and warfare, and many of them serve as soldiers or mercenaries in the armies of the empire. They are also skilled craftsmen, particularly in the areas of metalworking and blacksmithing, and are capable of creating intricate and deadly weapons and armour. Despite their fearsome reputation, some Imperial orcs have been known to form alliances with other races, particularly when it serves their interests.
