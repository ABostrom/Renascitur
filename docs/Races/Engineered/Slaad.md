# Slaads

**Summary:**  
Slaads are aberrant mutations of the [[Saurian|Saurians]], corrupted and twisted by exposure to aberrant energies. They embody chaos and destruction, threatening the fragile balance of the jungles of [[docs/Races/Solarans/Variants/Mokoweri]].

---

## Origins

- Result of reckless Solaran experiments trying to harness aberrant energy.  
- Once noble [[Saurian|Saurians]], now corrupted into aggressive, monstrous forms.

---

## Appearance

- Hulking, malformed reptilian creatures with chaotic and shifting features.  
- Display unpredictable mutations and aberrant traits.

---

## Culture

- No structured culture; driven by primal aggression and chaos.  
- Spread corruption and destruction wherever they roam.

---

## Abilities

- Unpredictable physical and magical mutations.  
- Highly aggressive and difficult to control.

---

## Languages

- Communicate through chaotic vocalizations and primal roars.  
- No formal language.

---

## Notes

- Controlled only temporarily by arcanometric obsidian crystals.  
- Their existence is a dire warning of the dangers of aberrant experimentation.

## Creation
**Research Log Entry #34**

The pursuit of understanding aberrant energy and its effects on living beings has taken a dark turn. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the [[Saurian|Saurians]]' resistance to abberant energy, some among us have become consumed by ambition. This has led to reckless experimentation that now threatens the balance of Mokoweri.

In an attempt to harness the properties of abberant energy for potential defensive applications, we initiated a series of experiments involving forced exposure of [[Saurian]] specimens to concentrated abberant energy sources. The results have been horrifying. These once-noble creatures have been twisted and corrupted by the very energy we sought to understand.

What we have created can only be described as aberrant [[Saurian|Saurians]], beings who have become conduits for abberant forces. Their existence is an affront to the natural order, and their aggression poses a dire threat to the inhabitants of Mokoweri.

In our desperation to counter the abberant incursions, we may have inadvertently unleashed a new kind of menace upon our world. It is imperative that we find a way to control or reverse this corruption before it spreads further.

**Research Log Entry #37**

The consequences of our ill-fated experiments have grown even more dire. The aberrant [[Saurian|Saurians]], which we now colloquially refer to as "Slaads," have multiplied beyond our control. Their aggressive behavior and destructive tendencies are wreaking havoc on the fragile ecosystems of Mokoweri.

To counter this threat, we have developed arcanometric obsidian crystals capable of exerting a form of control over the Slaads. These crystals emit resonant frequencies that pacify and, to some extent, command the Slaads. We have deployed these crystals in strategic locations to mitigate the chaos caused by these corrupted beings.

However, it is important to note that this is not a solution but a temporary measure. The Slaads remain an unpredictable and dangerous presence on Mokoweri. We must redouble our efforts to find a way to reverse the aberration and restore the [[Saurian|Saurians]] to their noble nature.

Our actions have consequences, and it is our responsibility to rectify the mistakes we have made. The Slaads serve as a haunting reminder of the ethical boundaries we must uphold in our pursuit of knowledge and protection.
