# Saurians

**Summary:**  
The Saurians are a deeply spiritual, reptilian humanoid race engineered by the ancient [[Solarans]] to resist aberrant energy. They inhabit the jungles of [[docs/Races/Solarans/Variants/Mokoweri]], living in harmony with nature and their deity [[Irasandra]].

- Created by the Solarans as bio-engineered guardians against aberrant corruption.  
- Distanced themselves from their creators to embrace nature and spirituality.

---

## Appearance

- Tall, muscular, with scaly skin in green, brown, and grey tones.  
- Adorned with bright markings symbolizing spiritual and clan identity.

---

## Culture

- Community-focused and deeply connected to the natural world.  
- Governed by an Elders’ Council and guided by spiritual rites.

---

## Abilities

- Innate resistance to aberrant energy.  
- Skilled hunters, warriors, and spiritual mediums.

---

## Languages

**Research Log Entry #12**

Our pursuit of understanding the Saurians' remarkable resilience to aberrant energy continues. Preliminary experiments have provided intriguing insights into the unique physiological and magical traits that make them inherently resistant to the corrupting influence of abberant energy.

In controlled exposure tests, we introduced Saurian specimens to concentrated aberrant energy sources. What we observed was nothing short of astounding. Unlike other living beings, the Saurians displayed an impressive ability to repel and neutralize the harmful effects of abberant energy.

This resistance seems to be linked to their innate connection with the weave, as if the Saurians have a natural barrier that shields them from the aberrant forces seeking to corrupt their souls. This discovery holds immense promise, as it could potentially lead to the development of protective measures against abberant incursions in the future.

However, it is crucial to proceed with caution. We must refrain from exploiting the Saurians' resilience for any destructive purposes. Their existence is deeply intertwined with the delicate balance of life on Mokoweri, and we must prioritize their preservation and well-being above all else.

**Research Log Entry #17**

Our ethical concerns regarding the experimentation on the Saurians have grown more pronounced as we delve deeper into the mysteries of their innate resilience. Despite the potential benefits for our society and the protection of Mokoweri, we cannot ignore the moral implications of our actions.

Today's experiments took a disturbing turn as we conducted invasive procedures on a group of Saurian subjects to further investigate the source of their resistance to abberant energy. These procedures resulted in significant distress and suffering for the specimens, and the ethical committee overseeing our research has expressed grave concerns.

While we have gained some insights into the Saurians' unique physiology and the role of their natural energy barriers, the toll on these noble beings is unacceptable. I must confront the moral dilemmas that our pursuit of knowledge has brought upon us. We must find alternative means to protect Mokoweri without subjecting the Saurians to further harm.

**Research Log Entry #20**

The weight of our actions in the name of scientific inquiry is becoming increasingly unbearable. We have reached a critical juncture in our research, where we must make difficult choices that will define our legacy.

In our pursuit of knowledge and the development of protective measures against aberrant energy, we inadvertently subjected the Saurians to unspeakable suffering. Their innate resilience, a gift from nature and the weave, should not have come at the cost of their well-being and happiness.

It is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge our failure in this regard. Our experiments have demonstrated the potential dangers of scientific ambition devoid of compassion. From this moment forward, our priority must shift to the welfare and conservation of the Saurians, our living guardians of Mokoweri.

We will redouble our efforts to develop protective measures through ethical means, ensuring that the Saurians are never again subjected to harm in the name of progress. We owe them our deepest apologies and our commitment to a brighter, more responsible future for all inhabitants of Mokoweri.
