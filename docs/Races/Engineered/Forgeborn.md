As the first of the Forgeborn, Forgeborn Prime [[Hephaestus]] was created with a unique purpose - to lead the charge against the forces of [[Entropy]]. With his advanced technology and mastery of the Soul Forge, he created an army of loyal warriors to aid him in his mission.

[[Hephaestus]] as the son of [[Vecna]]

Over the centuries, the Forgeborn have developed their own culture and society, with [[Hephaestus]] serving as their patriarch and guiding light. They see themselves as protectors of the universe and are fiercely loyal to their creator and to each other.

Despite their origins, many Forgeborn have developed a sense of independence and free will, questioning their place in the world and the nature of their existence. Some have even rebelled against their creator, seeking their own path and purpose.

But for the most part, the Forgeborn remain devoted to their prime directive - the destruction of [[Entropy|Aberrant]] and [[Ishna]] and all that threatens the balance of the universe. And with [[Hephaestus]] as their leader, they will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.
