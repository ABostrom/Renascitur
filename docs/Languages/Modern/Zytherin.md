# Zytherin

**Zytherin** is the **flame-forged dialect** of [[Elyssan]] spoken by the [[Velastri]], descendants of [[Solaran]] trapped and transformed by the harsh energies of [[Infernum]]. It reflects their fiery culture — sharp, rhythmic, and infused with the ritualistic complexity of their honor-bound society.

## Overview

- Zytherin emphasizes **harsh consonants and guttural tones** interwoven with melodic vowel shifts.
- It features an extensive system of **honorifics and ritualized phrasing** used in contracts, oaths, and magical incantations.
- Spoken Zytherin is considered binding — words carry literal weight in [[Velastri]] culture.
- Written Zytherin employs the **Noxan script**, characterized by angular, flame-like glyphs etched into obsidian or soulglass.
