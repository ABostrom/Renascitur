The First Age spans the rise and fall of [[Solara]] — from the divine shaping of the world by the [[Aeternum]], to the expansion of the [[Solaran|Solarans]] across the stars, and ending with the collapse of the Endless Sun and the imprisonment of [[Syuul, The Devourer|Lord Syuul]]. 

This age is marked by celestial ambition, divine harmony, and eventual [[entropy]]. It begins with the creation of the world and the blessing of the Elder Races, reaches its apex with Solara's galactic influence and the construction of [[the Endless Sun]], and ends in tragedy as corruption festers and the empire collapses into ruin.

It is remembered as an age of wonder, divine legacy, and hubris — the first chapter in the long unraveling of the world's balance.
