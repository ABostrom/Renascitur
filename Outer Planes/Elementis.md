The elemental plane surrounds the material plane, and is the only inner plane in the wheel of cosmology. It is a single plane shaped like a torus. At the boundaries of each elemental plane there are mixed elements. The planes consist of fire, water, air, and earth. 

The fire plane is adjacent to the water and earth planes, and the demiplanes between are the elemental plane of magma, and the elemental plane of steam. 

The water plane is adjacent to the fire and air planes, and the demiplanes between are the elemental plane of steam and the elemental plane of storms.

The air plane is adjacent to the water and earth planes, and the demiplanes between are the elemental plane of storms and the elemental plane of sand. 

The earth plane is adjacent to the fire and air plane, and the demiplanes between are the elemental plane of sand and the elemental plane of magma.
