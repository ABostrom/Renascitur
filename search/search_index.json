His research aimed to harness the potent, reality-warping forces of the Void to create new forms of life and power the Solaran defense mechanisms in their war against the corrupting influence of Ishna. However, his ambitions pushed him to dangerous extremes, as he began experimenting on his own kind. In a fateful experiment, Syuul subjected himself to aberrant energies, twisting his body and mind into something unrecognizable\u2014he became the first Illithid.</p> <p>Transformation and Betrayal: Syuul's transformation into an illithid was an irreversible process that severed him from his humanity. His Solaran colleagues were horrified as they witnessed his metamorphosis. No longer satisfied with the limits of Solaran science, Syuul began working in secret, driven by an insatiable hunger for psionic power and knowledge. His mind became a beacon of corruption, influencing others, and eventually aiding in the downfall of the Solaran civilization. After his initial betrayal, he aligned with Ishna, the God Unborn, seeing in her a kindred spirit of entropy and chaos. As his power grew, Syuul sought to spread the aberrant corruption across the stars, remaking the universe in his image.</p> <p>The Sealing: Recognizing the existential threat that Lord Syuul posed, the last remaining uncorrupted Solarans launched a desperate operation to trap him. With the help of the Saurians and Solaran technology, they constructed a secret containment facility deep beneath Mokoweri\u2019s surface. Syuul was sealed away within a powerful arcanometric crystal matrix designed to suppress his psionic abilities and prevent his escape. His influence on the island was forgotten as the centuries passed, though the threat of his return lingered in ancient texts.</p> <p>The Release: When the players inadvertently released Lord Syuul, the carefully maintained balance of Mokoweri began to unravel. His very presence has caused the delicate ecosystems, sustained by Irasandra, to wither and die. The life force that the ancient Gaian tree draws upon is being corrupted by Syuul\u2019s psionic aura, which pulses with raw aberrant energy. The island\u2019s natural cycles are failing, and even the mighty Saurians, created to resist aberrant energy, find themselves tested as the corruption spreads.</p> <p>Current State: Lord Syuul is a psionic demigod, a being whose mind can twist reality, subdue the wills of others, and warp the natural world. The air around him crackles with invisible psionic energy, distorting light and sound. Those who encounter him feel their minds being unraveled\u2014paranoia, delusions, and madness take root in anyone too close for too long. His physical form, once noble, is now a grotesque fusion of Solaran and illithid traits: elongated limbs, pallid skin stretched thin over alien musculature, and a head dominated by writhing tentacles.</p> <p>Despite his imprisonment, Syuul is not a passive villain. He is an ancient schemer, possessing a patient and cunning intellect. Now that he is free, he will begin enacting his plans to fully reclaim the island and spread his corruption. He views the players and the inhabitants of Mokoweri as mere tools to further his ascension into a being beyond mortality.</p> <p>Powers and Influence:</p> <ul> <li>Psionic Domination: Syuul can mentally dominate lesser beings, controlling their actions and warping their thoughts. The longer someone is in his presence, the more susceptible they become to his influence.</li> <li>Aberrant Corruption: Wherever Syuul treads, the world around him decays. Plants wither, water turns foul, and the very ground seems to rot underfoot. His corrupting aura spreads outward like a disease, slowly eroding the life force of the island.</li> <li>Psychic Schism: Syuul\u2019s mind is an unfathomable maze of psionic energy. Those who attempt to challenge him psychically risk having their consciousness shattered, resulting in madness or worse\u2014permanent subjugation to Syuul\u2019s will.</li> <li>Memory Leech: Syuul feeds on memories and knowledge, consuming the experiences of others to grow his own understanding. This allows him to anticipate the players\u2019 actions and learn of their past encounters.</li> </ul> <p>Endgame Aspirations: Lord Syuul\u2019s ultimate goal is to free Ishna completely and assist her in a cosmic conquest that would break the cycles of life, death, and time itself. With Ishna\u2019s power and his own mastery of psionics, Syuul plans to create an empire of aberrant life across the stars, with him at the apex of this twisted hierarchy. The players, whether they know it or not, have unleashed one of the greatest threats to Renascitur, and they must either re-imprison him or destroy him before he engulfs the world in chaos.</p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Creation/Corruption/The%20God%20Hand/Syuul%2C%20The%20Devourer/#memories","title":"Memories","text":""},{"location":"Cosmology/Creation/Corruption/The%20God%20Hand/Syuul%2C%20The%20Devourer/#research-log-1-initial-infusion","title":"Research Log 1: Initial Infusion","text":"<p>Solaran Sunspeaker: Aelarion Brightscale Date: Cycle 412, Epoch of Twilight's Lament</p> <p>Log Entry: Today marks the beginning of an unprecedented journey into the unknown.

Devoid of emotion, and the Lux that gives mortals their essence.</p> <p>Some Aberrations were cold, calculating and entered into uneasy pacts with their maker, others were nothing more than mindless servants, just extensions of their maker's will.</p> <p>Vecna reached out into the stars and saw glimpses of the destruction the God Unborn was reeking across the cosmos. Realising it was only a matter of time before his sights were set on his world (Oerth) he forged a pact with his friend Kasabian, and sought to protect their world. Realising the power that the God unborn could wield, and the manner in which he was corrupting mortal life. Vecna aided and built enormous war machines using arcanometry to battle the Aberrations. He built great machines that would house mortals, giving them the strength of 10 men, and the fire power of a highly trained wizard. This was not enough. They could stem the tide of the onslaught and gain respite. But year on year, more souls would be destroyed and more lives lost. The most prominent of which was his son, Hephaestus.</p> <p>The losses weighed heavy on his mind, and Vecna began to experiment with Necromancy and Soul magic. Vecna sought for a way to prevent his son from becoming that which all Oerthians had sworn to destroy. Vecna, experimenting with himself and his son, discovered the secret to immortality. He bound his soul to a phylactery and became a Lich.</p> <p>With the absence of a body, Vecna could not resurrect his son, instead he chose to bind him to a soul kristal Nox Lapis and house him in a machine of war. Hephaestus became the first of the Forgeborn\u00a0 and this signalled the turning point in the Last War.</p> <p>With an army of immortal steel warriors, and those whose souls could not be bound would soon be reborn again as the undead. Vecna realised those whose souls were already claimed by Noxarian magic can not be corrupted by Ishna</p> <p>\u201cFor only the light can be consumed by the shadows\u201d \u2013 Vecna</p> <p>\u201cOnly those who are trapped in the darkness can truly appreciate the light\u201d \u2013 Hephaestus.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Vecna summoned his war council, some of whom could not comprehend what he had done to himself. Kasabian, his most trusted general and friend, at first was horrified, he spoke with Vecna and was vehemently against the trajectory the war effort was going, Vecna forged for Kas a Necro sword of immense power, which he presented to Kas. Feeling the blade in his hands, the weight of the task ahead weighed heavily on his mind. The sword hungered for the souls of the fallen, even those twisted into aberrations.</p> <p>Eventually the army of flesh and steel drove back Ishna's assault. Unrelenting, Vecna pressed on, consumed in his 1000 year war to rid the Universe of Ishna he could not stop. He pursued Ishna' forces across the cosmos. Eventually devising a plan to seal her away.</p> <p>Vecna presented his plan to the war council again. Vecna revealed that in order to construct the hexweave pylons, each pylon would need the souls of a billion mortals on every world. Not enough to render a world devoid of life, but a serious toll on its inhabitants. Vecna argued that inorder to save trillions, they must kill billions. This level of sacrifice was a hefty toll. The council argued for weeks and deliberated. Vecna assured them all there was no other way.\u00a0</p> <p>Kasabian had grown weary, his trust in Vecna wavering. He stormed off in a rage vowing to Vecna that he had gone too far. \u201cYou are not a god, this is not your decision to make\u201d. \u201cSome prices are too steep, there must be a better way\u201d.</p> <p>He constructed the Hexweave pylons \u2013 large [[Soul]] Kristals born from the sacrifices of all mortals within that realm.</p> <p>The plan was set, all 6 hexweave pylons would need to be activated at once. Haephestus would guard the forge of souls, during the final assault as a fail safe.\u00a0</p> <p>The god unborn was sealed in the space between planes \u2013 where his power was diminished and the Hexweave pylons could contain his essence and prevent him from impacting the mortal worlds again.</p> <p>The god unborn\u2019s servants staged a retaliatory assault on the forge of souls, hoping to learn the locations of the pylons, and undo the binding of their master. A large force of aberrations and bound Slaads made their way into the forge and destroyed a large proportion of the machinery. Vecna managed to arrive in the nick of time, and save his son from certain death. It was in this moment of weakness Kasabian struck, killing Vecna and finishing off his son.\u00a0</p> <p>Many of his worshippers came and went. Seeking to release the god unborn and bring about his return. All failed. Vecna\u2019s undead servants bound to the mortal realm through necromantic magic have sought to protect humanity from his agents (The Souls of the Devourer). To them, the unending oblivion Ishna offers is all they seek.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is darkness, but the absence of light\u201d \u2013 Vecna</p> <p>When the world was reformed after the release of the God Unborn from his imprisonment, the universe and the balance of power shifted. Once, the world was a balanced mix of light and shadow. Now it is wreathed in eternal darkness, whilst the last flickers of light are dying out.</p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Gods/Third%20Age/Pantheon%20Of%20Luxar/","title":"Pantheon Of Luxar","text":"<p>![[Luxan]]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Gods/Third%20Age/Pantheon%20Of%20Noxar/","title":"Pantheon Of Noxar","text":"<p>![[Noxarian]]</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Cosmology/Gods/Third%20Age/Luxar%20Gods/Aubrek/","title":"God of Trade and Commerce, The Broker","text":"<p>Aubrek is revered as the god of trade, commerce, and wealth.

However, it will create a sanctuary within the Weave, a haven where mortal souls can traverse safely, shielded from the voracious appetite of the aberrations.\"</p> <p>The gravity of her words settles among the adventurers, a mixture of hope and daunting responsibility.</p> <p>\"This endeavor is not without its perils. The paths to these trees are veiled in secrecy, guarded by trials that will test your mettle, your wisdom, and the very fibers of your souls.

It is a beacon of light in the darkness, a guardian of passage for the souls who journey through the veil. But alone, it struggles, its light dimming under the shadow of the Aberrant plague.\"</p> <p>Her form flickers, a sign of the effort it takes to maintain this communication.</p> <p>\"The second tree, however, eludes my senses. It exists not upon our material plane but is shrouded in mystery, hidden from my sight. It is a puzzle, a mystery that beckons to be solved, for its discovery and awakening are crucial to our cause.\"</p> <p>A sense of resolve strengthens her voice.</p> <p>\"To aid you in this quest, I offer two Solaran devices, relics of a time when our technology and magic worked in harmony with the cosmos. These devices, once affixed to the sister trees, will amplify their capabilities, strengthening their connection to the weave and to each other, creating a triad of power that can stabilize the passage of souls and shield them from the Aberrant's grasp.\"</p> <p>With a gentle wave of light, two objects materialize before the adventurers. They are intricate, glowing with an inner light, their design both ancient and otherworldly, clearly crafted with a purpose far beyond ordinary comprehension.</p> <p>\"These devices are not mere tools but keys to a future where the machinery of death can once again operate without the taint of corruption. With the sister trees empowered, we can forge a bastion against the darkness, a safeguard for the souls who journey beyond.\"</p> <p>Irsasandra's presence begins to wane, her message nearly complete.</p> <p>\"Your path is fraught with peril, and the road ahead is unknown. But within you burns the light of potential, the courage to face the darkness. Take these devices, find the sister trees, and restore balance to the weave.\"</p> <p>As her form dissipates entirely, leaving the adventurers in the silent, sacred heart of the Eversoul Grove, they are left with a sense of purpose. Irasandra's trust in them, her belief in their ability to navigate the challenges ahead, imbues them with a resolve to venture forth, to seek the sister trees and play their part in the grand tapestry of the cosmos.</p> <p>As the final echoes of Irasandra's voice fade into the serene quiet of the Eversoul Grove, a soft, ethereal light begins to envelop the adventurers. It's gentle at first, a mere whisper of luminescence that caresses their skin, warm and comforting. But quickly, the light grows in intensity, swirling around them in a radiant vortex that seems to pulse with the life force of the grove itself. The air is filled with the scent of ancient magic, a fragrance that speaks of timelessness and the essence of creation.</p> <p>The adventurers, standing united in the heart of the grove, feel an overwhelming sense of peace and purpose suffuse their being. There's no fear, only a profound acceptance of the journey that lies ahead and the roles they are to play in the unfolding tapestry of the universe. The light, now blinding in its brilliance, reaches a crescendo, a tangible force of magic and energy that seems to resonate with the very core of their souls.</p> <p>And then, in the blink of an eye, the world shifts.</p> <p>The light recedes as quickly as it had appeared, leaving the adventurers blinking against the sudden change in their surroundings. Gone are the verdant tranquility and the ancient majesty of the Eversoul Grove. In its place stands the entrance to a ruin, a threshold carved from stone, weathered by time and adorned with symbols that whisper of a forgotten era. The air here is cooler, tinged with the scent of dust and the faint, lingering traces of magic long dormant.</p> <p>The adventurers find themselves at the very cusp of an ancient ruin, the first step on a journey that will take them across realms and through the fabric of reality itself. The light that had transported them here fades away completely, but its warmth lingers, a reassuring presence that reminds them of their purpose and the trust Irasandra has placed in them.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Geography/Mokoweri/Locations/Mokoruuth/","title":"Mokoruuth","text":"<ul> <li>Cultural Influence: Named by the Solaran's, whose pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment shaped their civilization.</li> <li>Meaning:<ul> <li>Moko: Derived from Mokoweri, symbolizing the land it resides in.</li> <li>Ruuth: A Solaran term for \"illumination\" or \"insight.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>Alternate Names:<ul> <li>Irasandra: A name used in modern times after Iris Andras merged with the tree.</li> <li>The Luminous Grove: A poetic name used by scholars.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Irasandra, the colossal tree that graces the island of Mokoweri, stands as a monumental testament to the forgotten era of Solaran science and their struggle to control aberrant soul experiments.

Constructed with both botanical and arcanometric precision, this towering sentinel was formed to fulfill a dual role: to maintain a sanctuary on Mokoweri and to protect the rest of the world from the dangerous experiments conducted there.</p> <p>The Quest for Understanding:</p> <p>Irasandra's origins are cloaked in the pursuit of knowledge. The Solarans of old, renowned for their wisdom and advanced arcanometric capabilities, embarked on an ambitious endeavor. They sought to comprehend the nature of souls, especially the rare occurrence of aberrant souls that manifested inexplicable deviations from the norm.</p> <p>The Enigmatic Anomaly:</p> <p>While they had not created these aberrant souls, the Solarans were baffled by their existence. They recognized that there was a fundamental flaw in the cosmic design of the universe, something that had gone awry and resulted in the emergence of these aberrations. They were driven by an insatiable curiosity to uncover the root cause of this enigma.</p> <p>Sealing the Island:</p> <p>Under the careful guidance of Iris Andras, the Great Sentinel Tree was infused with Solaran Obsidian, making it an entity of remarkable arcanometric power. Its primary function was to create a mystical barrier that sealed the island of Mokoweri from the rest of the world. With Irasandra's intervention, the island became a haven within which the Solarans could explore and rectify their transgressions without the risk of spreading the contamination further.</p> <p>Guardian of Mokoweri:</p> <p>Not only was Irasandra a barrier, but it was also a guardian of the island. The tree possessed sentient, arboreal consciousness, allowing it to sense potential threats and intruders. Its vast roots, intertwining with those of the indigenous flora, acted as an early warning system, signaling danger to the Solarans dwelling on Mokoweri.</p> <p>Enigmatic Legacy:</p> <p>As time passed and the Solaran civilization began to decline, the true purpose of Irasandra was lost to the world. The knowledge of its construction and mission gradually faded into obscurity. Nowadays, the inhabitants of Mokoweri have grown to revere Irasandra as a symbol of protection and an entity to be cherished, despite not fully comprehending its original purpose.</p> <p>A Soothing Presence:</p> <p>Irasandra now stands as a tranquil guardian, casting shade and nurturing the diverse ecosystem that has sprung up around it. The Great Sentinel Tree continues to be a powerful figure in the life of Mokoweri, its legacy intertwined with the island's identity, even if its original purpose remains veiled in the annals of time.</p> <p>Anomalies in the Weave:</p> <p>The world is ensnared in a complex web of cosmic energies and spiritual currents known as the weave. This ethereal lattice governs the transmigration of souls, the magic that binds the universe, and the equilibrium of forces. While typically a harmonious and balanced structure, the weave can be influenced and manipulated by powerful arcanometric entities, such as the Solarans.</p> <p>The Guardian's Aura:</p> <p>Irasandra, the immense sentinel tree that graces Mokoweri, is more than just a tree. It serves as a living, breathing component of the weave. Its roots and branches delve deep into the weave, interlacing with the cosmic threads that sustain the world. As a result, it generates a distinct and unique aura, a quality that veils Mokoweri in a protective and curious web of energy.</p> <p>Weakening the Aberrant:</p> <p>One of the most extraordinary manifestations of Irasandra's power is the weakening of aberrant souls within its sphere of influence. When aberrant souls enter Mokoweri's territory, they find themselves ensnared in a web of enigmatic energies. These energies, while not inherently harmful, seem to nullify the aberrant aspects of these souls, leaving them weakened and vulnerable.</p> <p>A Sanctuary for the Anomalous:</p> <p>The island of Mokoweri has unintentionally become a sanctuary for those afflicted by aberrant souls. It offers respite to those who carry the cosmic burden of aberration, allowing them a temporary reprieve from the turmoil and chaos that often accompanies such anomalies. Here, they can experience a semblance of normality, as their aberrations are gently muted by Irasandra's enigmatic aura.</p> <p>The Unintended Effect:</p> <p>While the Solarans originally sought to understand and rectify the aberrations in the weave, Irasandra's influence led to a different outcome. Instead of solving the cosmic mystery, it allowed Mokoweri to exist as a haven for the anomalous, an island where they can experience a modicum of peace amid their cosmic turmoil.</p> <p>A Silent Guardian:</p> <p>Unbeknownst to the island's inhabitants, Irasandra continues to weave its unique anomalies, gently affecting the souls that venture onto Mokoweri's shores.

The bioluminescent flora here pulsates with a vibrant, otherworldly energy, their roots extending deep into the essence of the world itself.</p> <p>This is the heart of Mokoweri, a place where life and the weave coalesce in a harmonious symphony. The plants here are unlike any I've ever encountered\u2014imbued with the very essence of the world. Their existence is a testament to the intricate balance that binds all living things.</p> <p>But what captivates me most is the ancient tree at the center of this chamber. It radiates a serene aura, its roots extending into the weave itself. This tree, a natural wonder, seems to hold the key to understanding the profound connection between life, the weave, and the machinery of death.</p> <p>This discovery may well be the missing piece I've sought in my quest to protect Solaran souls. The potential for further study and experimentation is boundless.</p> <p>Scientific Log Entry #2</p> <p>My exploration of the underground chamber continues to yield extraordinary results. I've named this place the \"Eversoul Grove\" for its potential to safeguard Solaran souls for all eternity.</p> <p>The essence of this place resonates with the weave, creating an environment where life flourishes in harmony. I've collected numerous samples of the bioluminescent flora and have conducted experiments to understand their unique properties. The potential for soul protection is immense.</p> <p>The tree at the heart of the grove is unlike any other. Its roots extend deep into the weave, and I suspect it holds the key to unlocking the secrets of soul preservation. I've gathered samples from this ancient tree, which I believe will serve as the blueprint for the creation of the world Gaian tree.</p> <p>My research here has been nothing short of transformative, and I am filled with a sense of purpose. The Eversoul Grove may well be the key to ensuring the eternal protection of Solaran souls.</p> <p>Scientific Log Entry #3</p> <p>Today marks a turning point in my research. After months of meticulous study and experimentation, I've come to a profound realization: the Eversoul Grove holds within it the blueprint for safeguarding Solaran souls, but it requires more than mere replication. It requires a bond\u2014a connection with the weave itself.</p> <p>As I stand in the presence of the ancient tree, I can sense its connection to the weave, the pulse of life that flows through it. This is more than a scientific endeavor; it is a calling, a destiny. To create the Eversoul Grove, I must become one with the weave.</p> <p>This decision is not made lightly, for it is an irreversible transformation. Yet, the fate of the Solaran people hangs in the balance. I must embrace this path, binding myself to the heart of Mokoweri's life force. Only then can I hope to protect the souls of my people for all eternity.</p> <p>Tech Workshop Research Log Entry #128</p> <p>The gateways we have been developing in the tech workshop are showing promise as tools for instant transportation across Mokoweri. By employing arconometric crystals and intricate calibrations, we have successfully created a network of interconnected gateways that span key locations on the island. This achievement is a testament to the ingenuity of solaran technology.</p> <p>These gateways not only facilitate rapid travel but also enhance our ability to respond to aberrant incursions swiftly. We have fortified them with arcanometric security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, they serve as a crucial means of evacuating vulnerable communities in the event of a large-scale aberrant assault.</p> <p>Our machinery for constructing experiments involving aberrant energy has reached a level of sophistication that allows for controlled and repeatable testing. This is of paramount importance as we seek to unravel the mysteries of abberant energy and develop countermeasures to protect Mokoweri and its inhabitants.</p> <p>The synergy of our research endeavors in the tech workshop promises to fortify our island against the ever-encroaching threat of aberrant forces. We remain vigilant in our pursuit of knowledge and innovation to safeguard our homeland.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Geography/Mokoweri/Provinces/Canopy%20Height/","title":"Canopy Height","text":"<p>This region is characterized by its vast, dense canopy that provides a home to countless creatures.

It is said that the iron in a skilled smith's blood was extracted, refined, and then painstakingly crafted into this deadly blade. The kriss, with its distinctive wavy blade, emanates a sinister aura, its surface etched with faint, pulsing red lines reminiscent of veins.</p> <p>![[f84287e4-8a75-4647-9970-57749cecdc4e.webp]]</p> <p>Appearance:</p> <ul> <li>Blade: The blade of the Blood Kriss is a deep, metallic red, almost black in certain lights. It has a serpentine, wavy shape, traditional to kriss daggers, which symbolizes both its deadly nature and the flow of blood from which it was made. The edges are unnaturally sharp, capable of cutting through flesh and bone with ease.</li> <li>Hilt: The hilt is wrapped in a dark, leather-like material that seems to pulse faintly when held, as if the blade itself were alive. The pommel is adorned with a small, blood-red gem that glows faintly, possibly infused with the last drop of the smith's blood.</li> <li>Overall Aura: The entire knife gives off a subtle, malevolent aura. Those who hold it may feel a slight chill and a faint whispering in the back of their minds, as if the blade is eager to taste blood once more.</li> </ul> <p>Properties:</p> <ul> <li>Blood Bond: The Blood Kriss has a unique bond with its wielder. Once attuned, the wielder can feel the knife\u2019s presence even when it\u2019s not in their possession. The blade responds to the wielder\u2019s thoughts, becoming a deadly extension of their will in combat.</li> <li>Lifedrain: On a successful strike, the Blood Kriss can drain a small amount of vitality from the victim, healing its wielder by a fraction of the damage dealt. This lifedrain effect also temporarily enhances the wielder\u2019s physical abilities, making them faster and stronger in battle.</li> <li>Blood Memory: The blade has a dark memory of all the lives it has taken. Once per day, the wielder can call upon the knowledge of a past victim, gaining insight or skills the victim once possessed for a short period.</li> </ul> <p>Curse:</p> <ul> <li>Bloodlust: The Blood Kriss is a cursed weapon. Over time, the wielder may begin to crave violence, becoming increasingly aggressive and bloodthirsty. The blade whispers to its wielder in moments of weakness, urging them to spill blood. If not regularly satisfied, the curse may compel the wielder to harm those close to them, even against their will.</li> </ul> <p>Backstory:</p> <ul> <li>Creation: The Blood Kriss was created by a master blacksmith who sought to create the ultimate weapon. Obsessed with the purity of iron in blood, he sacrificed his own life in the forging process, imbuing the blade with a piece of his soul. The kriss was said to have been used in countless dark rituals and assassinations throughout history.</li> <li>Legacy: The blade has passed through many hands, often leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Few can wield it without succumbing to its bloodthirsty curse. Those who do often become feared assassins or warriors of unparalleled skill, but at the cost of their humanity.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Aeloria%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Aeloria Ab Solara","text":"<p>The once-sacred city held an Ab Solara linked to the Irasandra Grove, used to control traffic into Mokoweri before the fall.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Arcane%20Observatory%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Arcane Observatory Ab Solara","text":"<p>The Ab Solara here once allowed elite researchers and Sun Speakers to access the geostationary facility above the material plane.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Cascadia%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Cascadia Ab Solara","text":"<p>Situated near the Eternal Flame, this gate powered the transport of raw Sun Topaz and bio-essence.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Elementis%20Aqua%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Elementis Aqua Ab Solara","text":"<p>A planar gate leading to the Plane of Water.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Elementis%20Ignis%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Elementis Ignis Ab Solara","text":"<p>A planar gate leading to the Plane of Fire.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Elementis%20Terra%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Elementis Terra Ab Solara","text":"<p>A planar gate leading to the Plane of Earth.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Elementis%20Ventus%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Elementis Ventus Ab Solara","text":"<p>A planar gate leading to the Plane of Air.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Eltabarr%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Eltabarr Ab Solara","text":"<p>Rumors suggest a salvaged Ab Solara was secretly reconstructed beneath the Crimson Spire\u2014its calibration remains unstable.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Lion%27s%20Rest%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Lion's Rest Ab Solara","text":"<p>Hidden beneath the Tomb of the Emperors</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Lunara%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Lunara Ab Solara","text":"<p>Built on the hidden moon base of the Solarans, this gate was likely used for off-world retreat and advanced experimentation.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Mechanum%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Mechanum Ab Solara","text":"<p>A precision-attuned gate connecting to the orderly plane of Mechanum.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Mokoweri%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Mokoweri Ab Solara","text":"<p>Sealed by Irasandra, the gate here is dormant but once enabled controlled access to the jungle isle.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Onderweld%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Onderweld Ab Solara","text":"<p>The now-severed gate that once bridged to the storm-wracked plane.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Solara%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Solara Ab Solara","text":"<p>Located at the heart of the capital, this Ab Solara served as the nexus of the global network.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Ab%20Solara/Thelassia%20Ab%20Solara/","title":"Thelassia Ab Solara","text":"<p>An underground gate within the industrial city, now dormant but partially functional thanks to Ferrun ingenuity.</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Hexweave%20Pylons/Mechanum%20Pylon/","title":"Mechanum Pylon","text":"<p>Location Sigmora Status: Online</p>"},{"location":"Realms/Renascita/Legendarium/Artifacts/Hexweave%20Pylons/Renascitur%20Pylon/","title":"Renascitur Pylon","text":"<p>Located under the city of modern day Baldur\u2019s Gate.

Echoes of every thought ever carried by wind, unshaped, unsilenced, eternally storming.</p> <p>He brought no forge, no metal, only silence. He carved a rune of Memory into the gale itself, using stone struck by lightning and bone hollowed by sky. The wind screamed its protest. It called his name in every forgotten tongue.</p> <p>When the carving was done, the clouds spiraled inward. Lightning cracked the world, and a spire rose\u2014grown, not built\u2014formed of stormglass and skyfire.

Into its basin, he poured runes of Containment, Temperance, and Burden.</p> <p>The flame still burns. It burns bright.</p> <p>The dwarves of the Flamebound do not quench it.</p> <p>They tend it.</p> <p>They say Muradin did not seal this wound.
